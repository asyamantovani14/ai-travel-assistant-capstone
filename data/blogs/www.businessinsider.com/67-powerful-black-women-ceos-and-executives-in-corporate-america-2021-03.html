Paving the way forward are women like Thasunda Brown Duckett, who is the CEO of retirement and investment manager TIAA. She is one of only two Black women chief executives of a Fortune 500 company.Duckett is one of 67 women featured in this collection of responses from influential Black businesswomen in America. Insider asked these executives, from leading companies like Google, Salesforce, and Amazon, to reflect on their rise to the top, the struggle of being a Black woman in white corporate America, and the best career advice they've received. Their answers — raw and poignant, emotional and inspiring — are below.What's the best career advice you ever received?\n        One of the most important roles I've had in my career was working as the deputy CIO of the White House under President Obama. The hiring process took nearly six months to work through due to the extensive interviews, vetting, and security reviews. As you can imagine, my anticipation and anxiety grew as each day passed and another hiring process milestone was reached. The day had come when I was to inform my current manager that I had accepted a new job and would be leaving. As I shared with him details about the role, he asked me how I felt. Nothing can describe the feeling of responsibility, influence, duty, uncertainty, and nervousness that I felt all at once. As I expressed that to him, he responded with, “That's great!” I was shocked and pretty taken aback by his response. It had been ingrained in me since childhood that you always have to appear to keep it together. Many times, we are told to put on a stoic exterior. Don't share weaknesses or vulnerabilities at work. But in that moment, I shared my truest feelings because I was leaving and had nothing to lose. After I gathered myself from his response, he continued with one of the best pieces of advice I have ever received. He said, “If you are nervous going to your next job, next project, or next opportunity, then it is the perfect opportunity for you. It means you will push yourself to give your all and be the best leader you can be.” Never before had I considered my uncertainty to be an asset nor how nervousness could be used as motivation. In a time where companies progress, technologies expand, and cultures evolve, it is OK to use our emotional consciousness to make us better and to drive us to great success.Is there anything you would do differently if you could go back to the beginning of your professional career? What is the lesson?\n        I would invest less energy in trying to “fit in” and devote more energy into standing out.Early on in my career, I received signals that I might “intimidate others,” including more-senior managers, because my credentials included a Harvard Business School MBA. I naively listened to this guidance.However, it didn't take me long to figure out that playing “small” would not serve me — or my employer — well. Once I empowered myself to fully be myself in every role, I achieved greater results and recognition. The lesson learned? “Own your bold!”As a Black woman, when did you realize you had \"made it\" in a white, male-dominated corporate America?\n        Truth be told, it is unlikely that I will ever experience that sensation in the way a question like this typically infers. Many women and people of color intuitively understand that it's a difficult and nuanced explanation as to why that's so. Suffice it to say that it's rooted in an awareness that the lens through which the world assesses our performance is perhaps sharper and longer than the lens used to evaluate others. So I simply choose to reframe what success looks like to me and what it means to “make it.” I love making a difference. Any pride in my personal advancements to date has less to do with my accomplishments and more to do with the success of others. The impact I've had on the lives and professional journeys of young leaders, especially women, that extends beyond my tenure at Marriott is important to me. My purpose is to model and remind them that they have a voice, they are required to use it, and that it's not the destination that defines us, but the quality of the unique journey we create for ourselves that matters most. There's no greater honor and responsibility than to lead people, to develop an environment that inspires, motivates, and helps others unleash their talent and reach their full potential. I love the work I do. I aspire to be the best leader I can and bring the best version of myself to work every day so that I, too, am ready for the tasks at hand. As I've matured as a leader over the last 30 years or so, my sense of what's possible for me in life has grown commensurately. I knew that I could make an impact. I wanted to make my family proud and be part of an organization whose values aligned with mine. I've done that, and I am exceptionally proud of — and profoundly grateful for — my Marriott journey. And from that perspective, I have made it.What's the best career advice you ever received?\n        I was a consultant in a big firm at the start of my career and kept getting assigned to engagements with a manager who was very difficult to work for. She provided little direction or guidance but was quick to criticize. She made my work environment unpleasant, and I strongly considered leaving the firm as a result.I had a mentor who was a partner at the firm, and I shared my experience and that I was considering leaving the company. The advice he gave me has stayed with me my whole career, and I have often shared this with people who have come to me for advice in similar situations. He said to me, “This manager of yours could leave the firm tomorrow, or next week or next month. Do you like this job? Are you learning? Are you growing? Never base a decision about your career on another person. That person could leave, be fired, change roles, and then you would have made a decision that was the wrong one for you and your career.”Sure enough, that manager was gone from the firm within a year. I learned that it is dangerous to both run to or away from opportunities based solely on who your current boss is. I have used that advice in a broader sense during my career in that I focus on making decisions about roles I take based on whether I feel they are additive to my skill set, progressive for my career, and that I like and believe in what I and the company are doing in the world.What's the best career advice you ever received?\n        The best advice I received early in my career, and one I try to impart on young women and men as they start out, is that you have to take control of your own development and career path. It is up to you, and only you, to define and achieve your professional goals.Do not rely on your manager or others to set the path for you. Then, once you have your goals defined, it is important to continually examine yourself and actively seek constructive feedback. Don't simply accept only positive feedback — ask pointed questions for critique that will help you grow as a leader.Be proactive. Be inquisitive. Be mindful. In doing so, you will control your own destiny to achieve your goals.What's the best career advice you ever received?\n        Listen, learn, and apply. You will always make mistakes. Don't be discouraged by them — they can teach you behaviors, skills, and tactics that will help you improve next time.I've learned to always be prepared, know my business, understand what might disrupt that business, and seek solutions, not just for today but for the future. I'd recommend seeking mentors to provide candid and transparent feedback. Earlier in my career, this advice would have positioned me to step out of my comfort zone. When seeking feedback, look for people who support your current journey and also those inclined to be more critical of your work and decisions. Seek out mentors with balanced feedback — it helps to build your confidence early in your career.When I mentor today, I make it a point to challenge the comfort level of the mentees and encourage them to take on challenging assignments that they would have overlooked before. Those assignments can strengthen and add to their skills — skills that are transferable and can open doors to new opportunities.Finally, your personal brand is very important. All of us are pleased and fulfilled when things are going well, but how you lead, coach, and manage when things are not going so well distinguishes good leaders from great leaders.What's your best advice to young Black women and men who aspire to your level of power, influence, or paycheck?\n        It's not all about how hard you work. Leadership and influence is personal. You have to connect with people. Some young Black women think you have to work twice as hard, and perhaps you do, but you also have to network, be visible, inspire others, and be inspired.As a Black woman, when did you realize you had \"made it\" in a white, male-dominated corporate America? \n        To say that I have “arrived” means that I have reached a destination. I don't believe I've arrived, I continue to evolve and grow, with many miles to go before I rest.As a Black woman in a white, male-dominated corporate America, I've had many experiences that enable me to pause, reflect, and examine my accomplishments and the impact that they've had on others. One thing I've learned is that the last word is mine. I can influence ideas and behaviors and can serve as a resource to others. I want to do my part to dispel myths and preconceived notions about what is possible so that others may follow.What's your best advice to young Black women and men who aspire to your level of power, influence, or paycheck?\n        Stay focused and find a great mentor for support. Ask questions and never be afraid to accept a challenge. Get the best education you can in your area of interest. Be self-aware and understand and appreciate your self-worth. Don't let someone else define that for you. It is OK to stumble, but pick yourself up and keep going. Be flexible and willing to learn alternate methods to accomplish your goals. Being flexible does not equate to being weak. Remember that compromise is not a bad word. You can win the battle but lose the war, but giving up is the enemy of success.Those challenging moments were those when I felt invisible, when people looked beyond or through me. That behavior enabled me to pause, self-reflect, and move forward to engage with those who did not reciprocate the courtesy. Although I would not equate this behavior as a hardship of being a Black woman in corporate America, it is only a hardship if women retreat instead of continuing their journey.If I could go back to the beginning of my career, I am not sure that I would do anything differently. Each stage of growth was calculated and helped prepare me for my current role. I was blessed to have mentors, managers, and coworkers that supported me and recognized my talents and contributions. I have always had the support of family and was never told what I could not do. When I graduated from law school, my grandfather told me that I could make a difference in this world, and that is what I plan to continue to do. I'm not finished making a difference. “To whom much is given, much is expected.”What's the best career advice you ever received?\n        My mom used to say to me, “Know your place but take your space.” While this wasn't shared with me as career advice per se — more like “mom wisdom” — it's something I've called to mind more than once throughout my professional journey.The intention is about understanding and respecting the boundaries of a professional dynamic but adding your voice in a way that shows your value. It's also about self-awareness and your ability to read the room, understanding when to push and show your authenticity, and when to hold back and accept a “no.”Though you may not always get the answer you want, people will remember how you showed up, and that's what will define you as a leader.Is there anything you would do differently if you could go back to the beginning of your professional career? What is the lesson?\n        If I could go back to the beginning of my professional career, I would define what success looks like to me. I would discover my purpose — my why — sooner, along with the value of building relationships.Several years ago, while attending a leadership program, it became clear to me that I hadn't taken the time to enjoy life. I was focused on chasing my next success, personally and professionally, but hadn't taken the time to clearly define it for myself. Doing so allows one to enjoy the journey and celebrate the achievements along the way.Taking ownership over one's goals is another nugget. Often, we look to others to help us achieve our goals, but we possess more power over our destiny than we realize. We need to have personal vision to achieve goals. Having a vision board can help. It allows one to clearly see and reflect on personal goals and the legacy you want. It also helps guide decisions and keeps one true to their purpose.My son, family, minorities that have come before me, and the next generation of leaders drives my purpose. I believe success is a gift, and I want to use my gift to improve the lives of others. I keep pictures in my office of family, historical pictures of our first store, and our founder and students who interned at Publix to keep me focused on what's important. They keep me grounded, and I recognize that it isn't about self — it's for a greater purpose. This provides reinforcement to persevere.Lastly, find a mentor, a sponsor, and protégés. These are all different people that are important for your journey. A sponsor assumes the role of speaking on your behalf. They often have a seat at the table and value the contributions you bring. They see your potential before you see it in yourself. A mentor is closer to you, meets with you regularly to advise and invest in your development. Having protégés allows you to invest in others, helping them grow and develop. A journey traveled with others is always more meaningful.What's the best career advice you ever received?\n        My best advice came from a senior leader early in my career. I was a new leader, and I had this suffocating fear of failure. I was often uncomfortable when interacting with senior leaders because I didn't want to make a mistake.After a meeting, this leader pulled me aside, and he told me, “Never let them see you sweat.” This turned into a great discussion about confidence. I had always assumed that leaders had to have all the answers. He taught me that while it's important to be competent, it's OK to be vulnerable, as no one has all the answers.Is there anything you would do differently if you could go back to the beginning of your professional career? What is the lesson?\n        Early on in my career, there were times where I felt pigeonholed or lacked the confidence to take the next step in my career. It wasn't until I received encouragement from my mentors that I unlocked my potential and began to grow. I learned to show up, keep up, and speak up daily.Once I became more confident in myself, I was able to take on many different challenges and positions across the company.So if I could give my younger self advice, I would tell myself to be more confident. And when you make a mistake or face a challenge, to learn quickly and move on.As a Black woman, when did you realize you had \"made it\" in a white, male-dominated corporate America?\n        I am incredibly proud and honored to be the first Black woman officer at Dow, but my mission is to make sure I am not the only and I am not the last.The reality is it has taken companies too long to get women to the C-suite — especially women of color. For example, less than 7% of Fortune 500 CEOs are women, and only three are women of color.There are several reasons for this, including culture and the lack of a diverse pipeline. It's important to cultivate corporate cultures where inclusion and equity are not just programs or initiatives but are business imperatives that are built into the fabric of the way companies operate and how they hold themselves accountable. When inclusion and equity exist in corporate cultures, programs, policies, practices, and behaviors, you can build a more diverse pipeline.As I think about my own journey, there have been critical moments that I believe made a difference: when I moved to Asia and worked as a general manager, when I became the commercial vice president for Dow's largest business in the largest region, and when I became Dow's first ever chief inclusion officer reporting directly to the CEO.What may surprise you is that each of these opportunities was less about me climbing the corporate ladder and more about my leveraging my career to fulfill my life's purpose: make the biggest difference possible with the time I have on the planet. My career allowed me to maximize my influence to help as many people as possible, be a visible example (because representation matters), and utilize my position to open doors and provide opportunities for others.So, you ask, when did I realize I had “made it”? I would contend I haven't “made it” until everyone has a fair chance to compete, everyone feels and is included, and I look back at a pipeline that is robust, diverse, and represents all talent. In other words, I will not have “made it,” until we have all “made it.\"What's the best advice to young Black women and men who aspire to your level of power, influence, or paycheck?\n        Well, my advice is not tied to an aspiration of pay or power but to an aspiration of purpose, which can take some time to discover.Focus on how you want to make a difference in this life. It's never too early to start the journey of discovering your purpose as the first step in being able to make a difference.Purpose is not discovered through your position but through living a life of authenticity, in both your career and your personal life. It took some time, but I discovered that my purpose is about creating positive change, which I've learned can only occur through the formation of rich and authentic relationships.Forming such relationships requires being bold enough to give of your heart and your soul. It means accepting vulnerability as a true human emotion, being courageous, and using your voice to have those difficult conversations.To do so may mean we risk how we are seen and heard and, ultimately, how we are accepted. It may also mean the risk of putting yourself in a lonely place because others are often not willing to go to that place of conflict where change happens.But vulnerability begets vulnerability, and courage begets courage. And I've learned that when our fellow colleagues — including the many white men in power — are willing to meet me on the bridge, it is courage that can move mountains and make beauty happen.Being a Black woman in corporate America is often excruciatingly lonely. But it is also empowering when I give all that I have and use my voice to speak up when so many others do not have the access to do so. So give of yourself, use your voice, be vulnerable and courageous. The positive change that can happen when you do so reaps rewards beyond measure.What's the best career advice you ever received?\n        The best career advice has come from my female mentors, beginning with Ronke Bammeke, who urged me to pursue my MBA at Northwestern University's Kellogg School of Management, despite my concerns about moving so far away and leaving behind a promising career at Guaranty Trust Bank in Lagos, Nigeria.Ronke showed me the importance of taking a “bet” on myself and the power of embracing change — growth happens when you step out of your comfort zone. Her advice opened up the world to me: I spent a summer interning in Australia, and after graduation I worked and traveled extensively across North America and Europe as a consultant with McKinsey & Co.I left McKinsey to take on my first P&L role at BMO Harris Bank, where Sandra Hanington quickly became another mentor. Shortly after she hired me, a reorganization positioned me for a bigger role working for someone else. I hesitated, but Sandra reminded me of the importance of leaning into change and challenge.This mindset later gave me the confidence to question the status quo while developing new products and, four years ago, to leave a P&L role to oversee operations. I sought operations experience for the enormous insight it has provided me into the heartbeat of the organization, leading the tens of thousands of colleagues who serve our clients every day. A willingness to embrace change again gave me the confidence last year to join Citi in the middle of a global pandemic.Stepping out of your comfort zone helps you learn something new, and over the years, it has kept me curious, energized, and humble. It has also helped me expand my network and created opportunities to broaden my impact as a leader.This is advice that I now share as a mentor. While many transitions come with some level of uncertainty and the risk of failure, you should feel confident in your abilities — and take that “bet” on yourself, knowing that if you put in the hard work, you can learn, adapt, and thrive through change.What's your best advice to young Black women and men who aspire to your level of leadership?\n        Despite my career progression, if I had it to do it all over, I'd be more confident in my abilities during my work life's earliest phases. I'd rely more heavily upon the individuals and groups who provide communities of support.Since moving to New York City and working at Con Edison, I've encountered professional support networks in abundance and have benefited deeply from engaging those communities on a more frequent basis. The concept of having a “kitchen cabinet” — friends, counselors, and other professionals whose varied opinions you value and respect — is part of embracing that community.My best advice for young people is to tap into communities of support, recognize and embrace the importance of being confident and taking risks, don't be afraid to try, and don't be afraid to fail, because if you're afraid to fail, you will never try anything.Learn from every experience, and apply a standard of excellence. Hold yourself to it in everything you do. Be honest, with yourself and others. Build relationships: Remember how important it is to engage others when you don't need anything from them.Don't hesitate to take full advantage of the community that's here to help you grow and thrive. And when you make it — and you will — remember where you came from and open the door for others.What's your best advice to young Black women and men who aspire to your level of power, influence, or paycheck?\n        It's important to have people on your side who believe in you and your purpose. And that doesn't just mean the CEO or your manager. Mentors are all around you. Look to the left and right. Those are the relationships that matter just as much, if not more: your relationship with your peers and equals. These are the people who will advocate on your behalf and will help build (and defend) your reputation and personal brand.What's your best advice to young Black women and men who aspire to your level of power, influence, or paycheck?\n        It is imperative to drive consistency in your own performance so that it never wavers from your true authentic self. By doing that, others will always know what to expect, and it ensures that the conversations for and about you never waver.•These are the key attributes to always bring to the table and stay grounded in.•Be heard for what you say and why you say it — stand behind your words. Don't let someone else speak for you.•Be honest with your capabilities and confident in your abilities.•Show up and be seen by showcasing the skills you possess — why are you there?•Be additive to a conversation and not disruptive. Never talk to just talk. •Be memorable, not remembered.•Making lasting impressions last.•Drive outcomes with sustainable results.•And lastly, be recognized and respected for your contributions.What is the best career advice you ever received?\n        When I was at Intel, I was fortunate to be mentored by Andy Grove, third employee and eventual CEO of Intel. He gave me the best advice I've heard, especially today: “In a crisis, bad companies die, good companies survive, great companies thrive.”As with, I'm sure, the rest of the world, 2020 was an incredibly challenging year for Zoox and myself personally. When the first shelter-in-place orders were put in place, my immediate thought was: “Zoox is done.”But in the hardest of times, I found myself coming back to Andy's words and telling myself that Zoox will emerge from this situation stronger.It ended up being self-fulfilling. At the end of the year, Zoox found the perfect partner for us, Amazon, and we successfully showcased the world's first driving purpose-built robotaxi capable of operating up to 75 mph. This also included more than 100 safety innovations that aren't in traditional cars — an incredible engineering feat.The journey was hard, but it also pushed us to think creatively, lean on each other, and cut away the nonessential work. I'm grateful for his advice, since it encouraged me to persevere and build a resiliency in myself and Zoox that carried us through the year.Now, I share my own version of this advice to others: Strengthen your resiliency muscles by raising your hand for the hard problems. You will either succeed, or you will learn. You will not fail either way.What's the best career advice you ever received?\n        Be coachable. From the start of my career, I found value in looking to my “board of directors” for insight and feedback. I'm referring to the close-knit inner circle who have helped me to make the right personal and professional decisions.My board of directors includes my husband and children, close friends, and others who share my values such as perseverance, resilience, and spiritual faith.I have achieved success by seeking input early and often from my personal board, and I trust their feedback. They believe in me, care about me, and challenge me to step outside my comfort zone, which has emboldened me to take risks and reach new heights in my career.Additionally, I don't take myself too seriously, and that keeps me grounded and real. I have written and own my narrative, and I make a conscious effort to stay positive, seek joy, and be grateful, empathetic and fun. So ask yourself: Who sits on your personal board of directors? Seek out the counsel of those who will encourage and support but also push and challenge you when you need it most. Be coachable.And be sure to give back as well. To be an effective member of someone else's personal board, you must share honestly the life lessons you've learned and encourage the development of deep, lasting relationships. Serve as a mentor, especially when your experiences enable you to make a difference, as I do with first-generation African American college students and graduates. Life is full of opportunities to help others by using your unique gifts, talents, and voice — and don't forget to laugh along the way.Is there anything you would do differently if you could go back to the beginning of your professional career? What is the lesson?\n        I've learned many lessons throughout my career, and one that most resonates with me is the value of relationships. I grew up in an environment where I didn't have lawyers or corporate professionals to look up to or learn from. I had to learn the soft skills and unwritten rules of corporate America while I was on the job.Early on in my career, I didn't fully appreciate the importance of relationship building and networking. I thought that hard work was the surefire path to success and that your efforts will be recognized.The reality is that who you know is just as important — if not more important — than what you know. It's vital to focus on building and maintaining a presence outside of the office, because that's where you create the space for future opportunities. It's how you develop relationships with individuals, whether within or outside of your company, who make sure you're being included in conversations about high-potential talent, job opportunities, or speaking engagements.As an introvert, building these relationships required focus and intentionality. As a Black woman, I faced the additional challenge of not having people in my organization who looked like me.I received feedback that I was too reserved, and that isn't often seen as a trait for strong leadership. I soon learned that while you don't need to be an extrovert to succeed, you do need to develop relationships that will be critical to your success. For me, this involved stepping out of my comfort zone and forcing myself to engage with new and different people.It's important to identify your blind spots early and foster connections that you can tend to and grow over the course of your career. One way to do this is getting involved in associations where you can meet like-minded peers in your professional space. Taking on a leadership role will help you build even stronger connections in those spaces. Whether it's attending events, investing in a career coach, or finding a mentor or sponsor, I came to realize that early investment in relationship building is a game changer.As a Black woman, when did you realize you had \"made it\" in a white, male-dominated corporate America?\n        When someone asks how I “made it,” I can honestly tell them I don't believe I have. One of my mentors taught me that you will never “arrive” if you're in continual pursuit of growth. If you think you're there, you definitely aren't, but you have probably lost sight of who you are. Who I am is always striving.I focus on servant leadership — giving more of myself for others than for my own gain. As a Black Jamaican Chinese woman, I stand on the shoulders of those who came before me in very real ways. I also carry the weight of a lot of people on my shoulders, but I've learned that it's OK to carry it. As a Black woman, I can't afford to make mistakes. If I do risk failure, I have to fail fast and recover faster — but I try to use that knowledge as fuel.Humility and grace remind me that carrying that weight is part of reaching a certain level of success — carrying that weight means performing a service I have earned for others. That can mean living with the pressure to always make a good first impression as a Black woman in business, knowing that the impression I leave may be imprinted on someone's mind as their definition of Black womanhood. Or it may mean dropping off snacks at a shelter for Black youth with my husband over the weekend, to help kids who haven't caught a break. It may even mean deciding to pray for detractors who may see me only through the damaging filter of their own prejudice, when they choose to see my mere presence as a threat.If humility is accepting that we can always push ourselves further, grace is seeking to understand the experiences of those around us — or when we can't understand them, to send them off on their journey, rather than engage in a toxic dialogue. As my mom taught me, grace reminds us of who we are and what life is all about, and I'll always be grateful for that.What's your best advice to young Black women and men who aspire to your level of power, influence, or paycheck?\n        First and foremost, I would say not to focus on a level of power, influence, or paycheck but instead focus on doing something that you absolutely love.Second, focus on doing that with people you like, respect, and share the same values as you. If you do those things with genuine passion and enjoyment, you will be set up to excel, and you'll be recognized and rewarded for your contributions.I love what I do and the people with whom I work at AbbVie. As vice president and deputy general counsel, I have fun every day because I am passionate about my work, endlessly curious, and I enjoy my time with coworkers. In addition to my litigation work, I also lead racial-equity philanthropic initiatives that seek to bring lasting and real change to help secure quality education, jobs, healthcare, and justice for underserved Black communities.Throughout my career at AbbVie, I have been fortunate that my talent was recognized, and I was rewarded, which would not have happened had I not found my unique calling and the right fit for me. I encourage all young people to pursue a career that brings them joy and to surround themselves with those they respect.What's the best career advice you ever received?\n        When I was a young lawyer, I was singularly focused on making partner at my law firm in the typical time frame of eight years and was concerned that having children and taking maternity leave would slow me down. I went to a senior woman partner at my law firm to seek her advice, and she asked me a simple but profound question: “Why are you in a rush?” Her advice was to take my time and make the career decisions that worked for me. It was the best advice I ever received because I stopped focusing on reaching specific career milestones in a specific time frame based on conventional wisdom and instead focused on making career decisions that were both professionally rewarding and worked with my life. That approach ultimately led to the career opportunity of a lifetime: working in the Obama administration, first in the Justice Department and ultimately at the White House as a deputy White House counsel. It was an unplanned detour from my private-practice path but an incredible professional experience that changed the trajectory of my career.What is the best career advice you ever received?\n        The best career advice I have gleaned has truly come from my lived experiences. It's a time to reflect on how and why something happened, then understand what you can do to be better prepared in the future.A defining moment in my career was when I was terminated from JCPenney in 2012 during a company repositioning. I had been working here for 34 years in various levels of responsibility, and while my performance was not in question, I was unexpectedly terminated from the company. I had grown up and relocated with this company, and this was the place that had provided me with many opportunities for growth.The termination gave me time to breathe and reflect. I learned that I had not been completely true to myself and had been operating under the “corporate mask.” I was eventually rehired by JCPenney — what I call “phase two” of my career — and since then, I have repositioned myself to be unapologetically me. This includes being transparent with my team, asking the questions others may not want to ask, fighting for what's right, and demonstrating vulnerability. The advice I give myself and others is: You have a chance every day to show up and be your authentic self — if it makes others uncomfortable, let them make the adjustment. That doesn't mean be rude or inappropriate; it means you deserve to operate without second-guessing your every move or filtering every thought because you're female or because you're Black.Upon my rehire, I put a mannequin in my office that remained undressed. That was my daily reminder to be authentic, don't get comfortable, and don't make others comfortable. In addition, that experience taught me to always be prepared for whatever twists and turns my career may take or decisions the company may make. We all perform better when we operate from a more authentic place and without fear of the future.I believe that everything does happen for a reason — fast-forward to today, and that growth period and experience prepared me for life's new challenges and being able to now navigate corporate life with a neurological disease that is impacting my vocals and mobility. It's a liberating place to be when your mindset and your preparedness allows you to just be you.“She is clothed in strength and dignity and she laughs without fear of the future.” — Proverbs 31:25What was the most challenging personal moment that illustrates the hardship of being a Black woman in corporate America?\n        About 10 years ago, I got an incredible opportunity to lead Allstate's procurement strategy, but there was a catch. The HQ was more than an hour north of our house on the South Side of Chicago — the one with deep roots, the one where we raised our children, a home where the doors were always open and the bicycles piled up outside. It was our family's anchor and I was heartbroken.I remember the encouragement of a close friend saying, \"Cheryl, you have to do this. You have to go.”In order to succeed as a Black woman in corporate America, I felt a pull to get in earlier, stay later, work harder. I had made those sacrifices for my career over the years, but I didn't want to move. My friend insisted, “Leaving people behind is OK because you can help a new group of people now.\"So we left the house, but I didn't leave my people behind.For me, the decision to move allowed me to not only advance my career but also to inspire and support the next generation of people who look like me. It brought me to a company where I make an impact through my work. I see racial equity increase here because our leaders understand it's about more than just chasing a number: It's about changing a mindset. It's about putting the right people with the right skills in the right roles. If you look at corporate America, you'll see a few more people now who look like me, but how do we keep the momentum? In the era of remote work, we don't necessarily have to move away from home to make a difference. Instead, our role is to speak up to move people and companies out of their comfort zones. So let's keep moving forward, together.What's your best advice to young Black women and men who aspire to your level of power, influence, or paycheck?\n        In today's environment, it's more important than ever to network with others in your industry and create relationships in the workplace. Skills, talent, and enthusiasm are a winning formula for success in any career, but meaningful opportunities rarely present themselves to people who are not socially engaging.This can include an occasional lunch or coffee — even virtually — as well as formal mentorships or coaching arrangements. While you don't have to “overshare,” you certainly should round out your work-related skills and attributes with enough personal details so that people feel like they know you.Simple things such as whether you come from a big or small family, have a favorite sports team or hobby, or any other information that you are comfortable sharing will give people around you a fuller sense of who you are and creates stronger working relationships.This is foundational for success for many, but is more important for young Black professionals who may not always have as many opportunities to engage on a more informal level. Make it a point to get to know people, and let them get to know you.What's your best advice to young Black women and men who aspire to your level of power,influence, or paycheck?\n        My 28-year journey to CEO of FedEx Custom Critical has taught me three important lessons inadvancing your career to the next level: Be intentional with your career, prepare to getcomfortable with the uncomfortable, and build your personal board of directors.Be sure to set a direction and develop a road map to ensure you stay on track with your careergoals. Your decisions should be focused on those goals. Continue to grow and stretch yourselfso that you are moving out of your comfort zone, into environments that challenge and growyour skill set.Build a personal board of directors. These directors are people who have authority to advocatefor you for your next career opportunity. Having individuals who are mentors, coaches, andsponsors can directly impact your career trajectory. Start with a mentor — a person who canhelp navigate your career. Mentors understand your goals and can give you the properguidance. A coach can help you sharpen your skill set. Once you have identified your careergoals, a sponsor can advocate for career advancement.Your board of directors can evolve. Your board will grow and change as your career aspirationsdevelop and/or you advance in your career. When you are intentional with your career, part ofthat is building relationships with people outside of your organization.Once you reach that success, your viewpoint might again evolve. My undefined dream ofsuccess I had as a child has evolved. I now define success as being able to have a positive effecton others, helping them grow and reach their full potential. I challenge young Black women andmen to never stop learning — never stop growing.What's your best advice to young Black women and men who aspire to your level of power, influence, or paycheck?\n        I would tell these ambitious young men and women not to be consumed with a quest for personal success. Being successful is absolutely fulfilling, but I would ask these individuals to consider the definition of success, and more so how to get there. Success takes many forms, and it's not always expressed in power, influence, or paycheck.In my experience, success, whatever your definition of it, is the result of three things.First is consistently doing the right thing, followed by working at the highest level of your personal ability and finally showing up each and every day with the goal to make an impact, whether that's in the lives of those around you or in your work. Success is a natural outcropping of these things. Ultimately, the real success — and satisfaction in it — comes from how you make a difference in the lives of people you lead, those that lead you, and the organization for which you work. It is impossible to rise to the top and achieve success without the inspired believers who are willing to serve alongside you to bring about change. You cultivate these inspired believers by making a difference in their lives and helping them fulfill their potential. That's how you find success.As a Black woman, when did you realize you had \"made it\" in a white, male-dominated corporate America?\n        I am always on a constant journey of learning and growing. I've never had a moment of feeling like I've “made it.” I tend to take on challenges that make me feel slightly uncomfortable or have an element of the unknown — that's when we experience the most growth and transformation.This is evident in my heading up marketing in Japan and Asia, or pivoting from sport and fashion to tech. I will feel like I've “made it” when we normalize underrepresented people in positions of power and when there is more equal representation of women in all fields at all levels.So I haven't made it until we all make it.What's the best career advice you ever received?\n        My dad always told me: “The best doesn't come easy. That's why there's nothing else like it.” Those words have always rung true in my life, and I reflect upon them often.As a leader, a lawyer, and a partner (what Starbucks calls its employees), I always strive to do my best, but I also recognize that as humans, we are never done learning. Being the best doesn't mean you're an expert on everything — it means through challenges, you welcome the opportunity to grow and build your tool kit to better prepare yourself for the next situation.In my experience, it has been in the times when I have pushed myself outside of my comfort zone where I have learned the most. You don't realize it at the time, but it's in how you navigate unfamiliar territory and find solutions that you grow the most and define yourself. So embrace the challenge, surround yourself with people who have diversity of thought and experience, and recognize you don't need to know everything on your own. You can be the best without being the best at everything.What is the best piece of career advice you ever received?\n        The best piece of career advice I ever received was that you need to be in the room even when you are not in the room.This was passed down to me by a female mentor who helped me early in my career. A former employer hosted a mentoring program that paired us with female leaders from other companies, so she was both wise in her counsel and not involved in the day-to-day business or politics of my company.She explained to me that most of the really important decisions about our careers are happening behind closed doors, so it's crucial to build a presence and a profile that will keep you top of mind with decision-makers even when not physically in front of them.To do this, you need to connect with — and become real to — as many leaders in your organization as possible. As my career progressed, I became extremely methodical and intentional about building relationships, regularly setting up meetings whether in my home office or another city or country. I went into the conversations eager to learn more about these leaders and found they were equally interested in learning more about me and my work.My natural tendency was to shy away from speaking about myself and my projects because I didn't want this to be seen as self-promotion. With time, and more conversations, it became clear that there was a double benefit to sharing my work. The people I met with offered new insights and fresh perspectives that made me better at my job, and they took away a deeper understanding of my capabilities and thought processes.Many people hate networking, but I deliberately sought out leaders who I admired and respected so the meetings always felt exciting for me rather than onerous. I always learned a huge amount about the company, my role, and the industries I worked within.Following this advice has paid dividends many times in my career. One of the most pivotal career breaks I ever received was from an executive who I had never met, who lived halfway around the world, but had received a recommendation from someone else I had connected with. When I got the call offering me a new role, it felt as if it came out of the blue, when, in fact, it came from my taking a methodical approach to being in the room even when I wasn't in the room.This piece of advice has been so powerful for me that regularly connecting with people whom I admire is something I do still to this day. I am less focused these days about doing this to advance my career and more focused on staying fresh in my own thinking and challenging my perspective.What's your best advice to young Black women and men who aspire to your level of power, influence, or paycheck?\n        My advice to early career professionals, particularly young Black women and men, is first and foremost to do your current job well. The most reliable way to advance is to demonstrate a track record of high performance.The next most important aspect of advancement is to make yourself replaceable. Developing strong successors enables you to take advantage of opportunities that may arise.The last piece of the puzzle for moving up the ladder is forgetting about the ladder. Every move doesn't have to be straight toward the top. Lateral moves can be great ways to broaden your skill set and gain business experience. Plus, working in different areas of the company can help you increase your organizational empathy and create more optionality for career growth. I also encourage young Black professionals to be authentic at work. Authenticity is critical to creating trust in the workplace, but it's often easier said than done. It may be challenging to show up as our true selves, but people have to know you to trust you. I have also found that talking about ourselves and our experiences is what makes an inclusive and engaged workforce.Finally, make time to prioritize self-care. I am a big believer that to keep from feeling out of balance, it is essential to make time for yourself and to invest in your friendships. Having friends who show up for you, and who count on you to show up for them, helps to keep it all in perspective.What's your best advice to young Black women and men who aspire to your level of power, influence, or paycheck?\n        There is no simple piece of advice that solves the Black experience. It's complex. What I have come to understand is that embracing your difference can be a source of power. I grew up with a mother who was often the “only.” She was the first person in her family to start a business and one of a few women who worked outside the home. I learned from her how to be at peace with tension, how to navigate adversity, and how to thrive when going against the grain. As a Black woman in tech, I have lived through my own set of “only” experiences. Constantly having to orient my world view to that of others, a spotlight always shined on me. It wasn't always a good one and not one I asked for. There was also plenty of rejection and isolation. The first few times it felt awful — walking away is not easy and, of course, you can't walk away from yourself. I realized that moving forward meant going against the grain, so I embraced the habits I had formed to manage my differences, using my ability to see both sides of a problem to become a stronger negotiator, empathetic leadership to curate people with difference, always stirring the pot, and pushing others to join me in the constructive tension where innovation flourishes. Seeking out opportunities to go against the grain even further, great personal satisfaction and professional success is found when taking the most underserved, undervalued segments and turning them to significance. Whether advocating for female entrepreneurs, going overseas to emerging markets or taking complex jobs, I raise my hand for opportunities to stay uncomfortable. Most importantly, I make sure to be chasing more: to do meaningful work, to give back, to contribute. Purpose sustains passion; passion fuels success. My mother was resilient. She went against all the norms, with plenty of failings along the way. Each one was a learning that widened the net for me. I hope my experiences will cast the net even further giving the next generation the courage to take bold risks and embrace their “only.\"Is there anything you would do differently if you could go back to the beginning of your professional career? What is the lesson?\n        I have always been a hard-working, make-it-happen type of person, but it took me too long to embrace the power and advantages of one specific skill: networking.Early on, if I had learned to network more effectively, I would have found supporters, sponsors, and helpers a lot sooner.My biggest lesson from this is that there often are many people rooting for you. Learning to reach out and network allows you to meet them sooner and allows them to have a more hands-on role in helping you grow.What was the most challenging personal moment that illustrates the hardship of being a Black woman in corporate America?\n        The question presupposes one defining experience. But for me and many others, it has been a smorgasbord of negative experiences which start at a young age. This includes outsize discipline or criticism for behavior frequently exhibited by children in the majority and low expectations coupled with moments of shock and awe when mundane tasks are accomplished. Unfortunately, these are experiences I now relive through my two sons. There were variations on this theme throughout my education.When I moved into professional life, certain undermining experiences occurred with frequency: (1) having my counterpart speak directly to my subordinate (usually a white male) assuming he was the decision-maker when I, the Black woman, was; (2) being mistaken for support staff; (3) receiving looks of confusion when I stated my title. These are but a few examples.On my first day as an Assistant United States Attorney in Manhattan, I went to court to watch another AUSA complete an arraignment proceeding. When I began to introduce myself to my colleague, he barely made eye contact and directed me to another table. He then asked that I provide a report on the defendant. My confusion led to his frustration, and he sharply asked again. “I am a new AUSA,” I explained, “and I am here to watch you do an arraignment.” “Oh, sorry, then I guess you should sit over by me at the government's table,” he responded with surprise. This experience may seem minor, but some iteration of that moment where people assumed I was anything but an AUSA happened so regularly over the course of my tenure that I didn't have the luxury of outrage. Rather, I used these experiences to identify true allies and we focused our energy on supporting each other.Why articulate these challenging personal moments? Two reasons. First, to highlight how commonplace these slights and diminutions are and to show that despite the hurt they cause, ultimately, they are not determinative if and only if we surround ourselves with allies, supporters, and those that help sustain us. Second, to speak directly to other Black women who have had similar experiences — a sort of Michelle Obama/Kamala Harris “finger-point” moment — I see you, I am here, now go out and be great because you are.What's the best career advice you ever received?\n        The best piece of career advice I've received came from a mentor when I was beginning my journey in the legal profession. It was to remember to keep my eyes on the horizon: A career path isn't always linear, but if I continue to deliver top-notch work product and keep the ship pointed in the right direction, the hard work will pay off.If it hadn't been for that advice, I might not have gotten into privacy. It was a fairly new field at the time, and many were surprised that I would leave a more senior position to take a more junior position in a lesser-known area of law. “Why would you want to do that?” was a common question people asked. But I was excited about the challenge, willing to put in the work, and ready to expand my skill set. Most importantly, I believed that no matter what, the direction was a good one and that the path would serve me well. All these years later, the field continues to be incredibly simulating, and the continued hard work has led to multiple opportunities for advancement. And I still look forward to the horizon.What's the best career advice you ever received?\n        The best advice I ever received was to take risks and embrace challenging roles. Too often, we tend to stay in our comfort zones, focusing on jobs that are familiar and aligned to our current skills. One of my mentors encouraged me to never take the easy way out. It's OK to be slightly scared of a daunting challenge, which is a mindset that has guided me throughout my career. Taking risks comes in many forms. I've accepted roles that have required me to lead widespread change across an organization, implement new and progressive talent strategies, and fix organizational deficiencies.As a Black female leader, I've also embraced joining organizations in which there were few people of color in senior management. I found these roles challenged me to sharpen my influencing skills, introduce new ways of thinking, and enable cultures that lead to more diverse and inclusive workforces.I also believe that mission-driven organizations provide depth to my work, knowing that I am contributing to goals that seek to improve society. This was one of the main reasons I was attracted to my current role as chief human-resources officer at UnitedHealth Group. Looking back now at my first year with the company, the challenge of supporting a global healthcare workforce of 330,000 during a pandemic certainly was the ultimate stretch assignment.From a personal standpoint, I've learned to be comfortable with being a pioneer of new ideas, making bold decisions that may conflict with conventional views, and staying true to my belief system. I've had the chance to relocate eight times over the course of 25 years for the right opportunities. When you accept the vulnerability that comes from taking risks and being uncomfortable, it can lead to rewarding growth — professionally and personally.What's the best career advice you ever received?\n        A very smart man asked me two questions at the age of 15. The first was, “What race are you?”At 15, it gave me pause because I thought he knew what race I was. I said, \"I'm Black.\" And he said, \"OK.\"The man then asked, \"What are you? Are you a male or a female?\"I said, \"Well, of course, I'm a female.\" He replied, \"OK. All that means is that you might need to run a little faster and jump a little higher to get to the starting line. But once you're there, you're just like everybody else — you're equal.\" At the time, I didn't quite understand what he was saying. But as I matured, I knew what he meant: Be prepared and know your value. Your life should be filled with preparation, and once you really know your value, you'll build self-confidence. And with that, you'll be able to withstand the challenges of feeling that even though your looks might set you apart from others, knowing your value is your truth, your center. And no one, not even your boss, can take that away.So when I put my feet on the ground every morning, I get up and I go to work for myself. I don't get up and go to work for my boss or the company. I work for Pam. I get up being my best self and delivering my best work, and no matter what the outcome is, I'm comfortable. I'm OK with the negative and the positive because what I've done is given my very best.If you pull all these things together, that is what success means for me. It means personal self-value and your own placement in the world.My father was a very smart man.What was the most challenging personal moment that illustrates the hardship of being a Black woman in corporate America?\n        I'm originally from Tanzania, where my family lived in poverty. Our home had no running water, electricity, windows, or doors. I worked incredibly hard in school and was one of two students in the country selected to attend an international high school in Norway. I then received a scholarship to attend Mount Holyoke College in the US, and while in college, I interned at Merrill through SEO, an organization that helps diverse students secure internships on Wall Street and other top companies. SEO is a great organization that I continue to support today.In order to stay in the US after graduation, I had to secure a job offer and graduate early. I pitched a senior Merrill executive for a job with a clear deadline, and on the day of the deadline, the offer came through. I have been growing and advancing my career at Merrill ever since. Recently, I was promoted to head of asset-manager relationships for the investment-solutions group.From completing high school in a foreign country speaking a foreign language to crossing an ocean with only $20 in my pocket and having to graduate early and secure a job to maintain my Visa, I have faced many obstacles on my journey. I attribute my ability to overcome these obstacles and success to working incredibly hard toward specific goals.Two goals kept me focused and driven. First, I want to help my family back in Tanzania. My success has afforded them many advancements, such as a new house, a car, and education for my siblings. Honestly, failure was never an option for me because of this.Second, I want to inspire others to overcome obstacles and strive for success. A lot of people out there might not believe someone with my background can be where I am today, but I'm proof that with hard work, clear goals, and the support of a great company, anything is possible.What was the most challenging personal moment that illustrates the hardship of being a Black woman in corporate America?\n        There are many personal moments to which I can point that illustrate the hardships of being a Black woman in corporate America. While the marks left from these moments are often indelible, put into perspective and in isolation, many of these moments could be considered rather insignificant. The true hardship and stress can come from the persistence and the aggregation of these moments/microaggressions over time.One such microaggression is that of mistaken identity. In a prior role, my organization would host annual events for our executive clients. As one of the senior leaders on the team, I was expected to attend the events along with my peers and my boss, the division president. During the welcome dinner for one of the sessions, a customer approached me and said, “You're who answers the phone when I call. Nice to finally meet you!” I knew I had never spoken to this person before, and in that moment I realized he had mistaken me for my boss' administrative assistant. As the only Black woman in the room, I did not fit the description of an “executive,” so I had to be something other than.This certainly was not the first time in corporate America that I had been mistaken for something other than an executive, and it would not be the last. As a Black female executive, it can be challenging to assume my rightful place in the room when I am not who others expect. The hardship is not created the first time nor the last time this happens — it is all of the times added together. However, strength and motivation are often born out of hardship. These moments teach me that my role as a leader is less likely to be presumed and I have to be confident enough in who I am to assume that rightful place whether others expect me there or not.What was the most challenging personal moment that illustrates the hardship of being a Black woman in corporate America?\n        Early in my career, I was selected to be part of a development program and was thrilled to be part of this elite group. But I quickly learned my inclusion was not welcomed by the program leader. Comments like “you need extra help” or “you are lucky to be here” were frequently mentioned. They were always said privately, accompanied by a feigned smile. I soon discovered similar comments had been said to another woman, a Mexican woman, whom I will call Anna. It did not take much time for Anna and me to form a strong friendship, and we decided to complete a required make-or-break project as part of this program. We worked diligently for months and had mentors who were always willing to hear our ideas, answer questions, and provide guidance. We were confident our proposal was sound.Judging our plan was a panel of executives. During our pitch, we answered every tough question. At the end, drenched in anticipation and pride, the oddest thing happened. The panel met privately, came back, and decided that our proposal needed to be fact-checked.Anticipation and pride were replaced by shock. I remember wondering if I had heard them correctly. Of course, we knew this was our work, down to the selection of the baby-blue cover sheets and 2-inch spiral binder. We quickly came to discover ours was the only pitch questioned. Ultimately, the truth prevailed. The panel confirmed the business plan was ours. We later learned through a source that our pitch was one of the best seen in years: redemption — you would think. Nonetheless, this event damaged our confidence and sense of worth.As leaders, we must remember we have a tremendous gift. We have the power to not only influence one's career but to shatter one's confidence with our words and actions. Use this gift to empower and build up young professionals, especially women and people of color.What is the best career advice you've ever received?\n        “Ask for what you want to get what you need.”My whole career changed when I put this advice into practice. I had worked in human resources for many years, rising to vice president and overseeing HR efforts for Constellation's commercial retail and wholesale businesses and enterprise risk management for Exelon. I was comfortable in my craft, solid in my skills. But I got the itch to stretch myself, to move into the business side of the organization and try something new.What if I failed? The thought of it made me feel unsettled and uncomfortable. Choosing success can be scary. But FEAR is just False Evidence Appearing Real. It can cripple us if we allow ourselves to listen to it. I listened to my own voice instead.“You have taken many different risks at work and in your personal life,” I told myself. “You've always made it work. Why would this be any different?” And then I asked for what I wanted. I told the CEO and president of retail I was ready to move into a business role. Within a few months, I was leading BGE Home as president and CEO. My career has continued to grow from there, with the help of my community of family, friends, and sponsors who were willing to place bets on me and strong relationships with people of different backgrounds, experiences, and perspectives.As professional men and women of color, we can't hope that if we put our heads down and work really hard people will simply notice it and make great things happen for us. It just doesn't work that way. So ask for that assignment. Ask for help when you need it. Ask for career development, expanded roles, and compensation commensurate with your contributions. Don't let discomfort disable you. Speak up — closed mouths don't get fed.And dream big. As Ellen Johnson Sirleaf, the first woman president of Liberia, famously said, “If your dreams do not scare you, they are not big enough.” Now go out, be great, and slay.What's the best career advice you ever received?\n        Everyone should continuously measure their own performance to better understand if they are meeting expectations. Each day, you should be able to determine how much value you've added and rate yourself accordingly.If you had a good day, continue to push yourself to succeed, but if you fell short, be open to challenging yourself to accomplish more in the future. On an annual basis, when it's time to close out the year, consider these accomplishments a distant memory, start over, and begin to demonstrate your value again. Is there anything you would do differently if you could go back to the beginning of your professional career? What is the lesson?\n        I would encourage myself to be more confident in taking risks in my career. There were many opportunities presented to me that were outside of my comfort zone, but I didn't take any major risks until I moved to Asia later in my career journey.I believe the lesson is to be confident in what you bring to each role and to rely on your talents as insurance against the risk. As a friend of mine once advised, “Sometimes not taking a risk is itself risky.”What's the best career advice you ever received?\n        The best piece of advice I got from a mentor early in my career, which has absolutely come true, is: “Having a plan is a good foundation, but it only takes you so far. Remaining nimble and open is the key to success.”To me, this has meant that my fear of failure is far outweighed by my capability to exceed my own expectations. All professionals, especially women, should be more receptive to this possibility. Don't shy away from the unexpected.What's your best advice to young Black women and men who aspire to your level of power, influence, or paycheck?\n        In short, focus on what you can control. While larger problems exist — such as institutional bias — these are much more complex issues that we don't have immediate control over. It's our shared responsibility to fight against institutional bias, but the best way to do that is by focusing on what you can directly and immediately impact — your work, your contributions, and how you show up every day.In each moment, you have control over how you present yourself, the effort you put in, the outcome of your work, and the value you add to each conversation or project. By drawing attention to the ways in which you are positively contributing, you are naturally fighting against institutional bias by demonstrating your value.This is important regardless of our background, color, religion, etc. This is the best way that we, as individuals, can fight these larger battles — all while being more fulfilled in your daily life because you are making a difference in the things for which you have direct control.What's the best career advice you ever received?\n        It's not necessarily a single piece of advice but more of a compilation of wisdom gained through my mentorship network and the course of my career.•Be purpose-driven: Work for companies and people whose mission you believe in, where your contribution makes a difference, and with people who believe in you.•Build diverse networks, and find mentors that have achieved the position, skills, and outcomes you are interested in achieving.Ask powerful questions.•Feedback is the breakfast of champions — embrace it and value failure. While valuing failure may run counterintuitive to what we have been taught about success, if you are committed to defying the odds or producing incredible outcomes, “No, not that” is as much a part of the equation toward success as “More of this” and “What's missing” is to the vision itself.Rinse, wash, and repeat.What's the best career advice you ever received?\n        The best career advice I have ever received came from my father, who rose to chief master sergeant, the highest rank for an enlisted man in the USAF. First, he told me that I needed to work harder than anyone else because as a minority, nothing was ever going to be given to me. And secondly, he told me not to worry about what others received — I just always needed to do my best. My dad instilled in me a strong work ethic and the confidence that if I did my best, I could achieve anything. I am so grateful for his advice. I try to pass it on whenever I can.Is there anything you would do differently if you could go back to the beginning of yourprofessional career? What is the lesson?\n        If I could go back and speak to my younger self, I would tell me to enjoy the journey, embrace the challenges, and lean into my network. I look back and realize that at times. I was so stressed about not achieving perfection or not having all the answers that I missed the opportunity to appreciate the learning moment that I was in the middle of living.Whether it be a challenging customer, a discerning boss, or feeling like I did not measure up, with every challenge I faced, I would first find criticism within myself. And yet I always came through the other side better, stronger, and more knowledgeable about how to face the next opportunity. I have learned to believe that while I may not have all the answers, I start from a place of wisdom. I am a collection of all my experiences, and I have the will and tenacity to be anything I put my mind to.I also learned that my network was critical. They supported me, partnered with me, and many times were my advocate or sponsor. Earlier in my career, I did not appreciate that your network requires nourishing. It requires you to give as much as you take. Your network should be complex, diverse, and inclusive. It should include those at different levels, different backgrounds, and varying race and gender. A strong network makes you better because you learn from them as they learn from you. Life doesn't always introduce you to the people you want to meet. Sometimes life brings you people who will help you turn into the person you were meant to become.My encouragement to all, whether you are beginning, in the middle of, or wrapping up your career, is to live each moment to the fullest. Learn from every mistake and success. Learn to love yourself just a little bit more each day. And create a culture where your team can learn, thrive, and reach their full potential. And don't forget that when you have the opportunity to help, to support, to promote, to be kind, do so.What was the most challenging personal moment that illustrates the hardship of being a Black woman in corporate America?\n        As I reflect on my career journey, there are many moments when I've experienced the hardship of being a Black woman in America. In two of those moments for me — one very early in my career and the other much later — I was treated the same way. Why? Because no matter how successful I had become, I was still a Black woman.The first occurred when I was a new lawyer. I was about to take my first deposition and arrived at the opposing law firm's office. As I arrived in the room with the other lawyers, one of the white male partners in the firm said to me, “Oh, good. I'm glad you're here. Can you get us all coffee?” I was stunned as I awkwardly explained that I was the lawyer taking the deposition, not an assistant. After the deposition was over, I pulled the partner aside and explained to him how inappropriate his assumption was and how it made me feel. He was shocked and extremely apologetic.Twenty years later, I was promoted to a high-level position at a major Fortune 500 company, which came with exclusive executive parking-garage perks. As I drove up, the white male parking attendant literally laughed in my face as he explained multiple times that I needed to go to the other parking garage because this one was for the “higher-ups.” His clear implication was there was no way I was one of the “higher-ups.” A week later, I found myself in his boss' office, where he uncomfortably apologized to me while his boss tried to justify his behavior by blaming the situation on a paperwork mix-up.Most Black women in corporate America endure this type of disrespect frequently, judiciously determining which battles to fight and which ones to swallow, and yet we still manage to lift up our chins, put our feelings aside, and perform excellent work. These experiences build strength and resilience in Black women; however, I hope that through navigating and sharing these encounters, we are also educating the ignorant and shifting their perception of what a corporate executive looks like in America.What's the best career advice you ever received?\n        Some of the best career advice I've received is to keep saying yes — especially to the nonobvious choice. Too often, I think young professionals can feel pressured to take the “right” path toward growing their career. This is particularly true for women and young professionals of color who may feel pressured to tick off certain boxes in order to achieve success commensurate with their white male peers. Coming out of my undergraduate degree, I was a history major — I went to Stanford and I had student loans. But rather than become a professor or pursue my law degree, I decided I was going to go the business route, and I worked at a company that sold nuts, bolts, and screws (wearing steel-toed boots every day). Risks, once you take them, often aren't as risky as you thought from the outside. Every unconventional choice you make — whether that's taking a job overseas, or at a company no one has heard of, or in an industry people aren't familiar with — gives you a unique experience that ultimately pays off in spades and increases the value you bring to a role.What's your best advice to young Black women and men who aspire to your level of power,influence, or paycheck?\n        I offer three pieces of advice for young Black people entering the workforce — be your own advocate, have a strong network of mentors, and embrace who you are.Advocating for yourself is crucial. Believe in yourself, and take the seat at the table if it's been given to you — and use your voice to share different insights or perspectives that may not otherwise be represented.As far as mentorship goes, everyone needs allies and truth tellers you can trust and connect with on a personal and professional level. My father was an incredible mentor for me early in my career, and I learned this lesson from him, which has been core to my career journey — and priceless. I have made a conscious effort to pass this sage advice forward wherever I've been able.Lastly, it's not often that I am at a table with others who look like me. It's hard to articulate how that feels, but what it has manifested for me is resiliency, a strong sense of personal agency, and a desire to sponsor and support other Black women on their career journey. My advice is to make career choices that will help you remain true to who you are — your style, personality, values, and experiences are unique. Do not shy away from who you are for a job.One of the things I value about Nordstrom is that we are an organization that fosters a culture of belonging for all employees, and we have recently announced goals to increase diversity throughout all parts of our company — from the brands we carry to the talent we hire and promote.We've spent a lot of time exploring what diversity, inclusion, and belonging should mean at Nordstrom, which helped define our strategy and leader-led approach. The events of 2020 accelerated our work and being more transparent by publicly communicating organizational goals that will drive key actions and outcomes in the next phase of our journey. We're committed to doing the work, being transparent about our progress, listening to feedback, and holding ourselves accountable.What's the best career advice you ever received?\n        Reflecting on my career and the fortunate opportunities I have been blessed to have, I am reminded of a compilation of career advice I've received, and that has guided me. The best one is simply this: Tell your story through your own lens, and don't shy away from sharing your cultural experiences, cultural achievements, and hardships, when relevant, that have made you you.Conformity is boring. I have learned to lead with my strengths, like my dedicated work ethic and burning desire to learn (not all opportunities came my way fairly, nor with ease); strength of empathy, having experienced injustices personally and as a Black race; strength of relationship building and finding common ground; and strength of “going for the gold” because you may only have one shot.I try to lead with all those mentioned in my work life, with clients, and in other important areas of my life, as such strengths are important parts of who we are.As a Black woman, when did you realize you had \"made it\" in a white, male-dominated corporate America? \n        I remember it as clear as day. At the time, I was a partner at a large consulting company where I felt that every other partner was more accomplished than I was, more successful than I was, and smarter than I was.Later on during a partner meeting, we were having a discussion that seemed as if it wouldn't end optimally. In the meeting, I gathered my thoughts and offered three reasons why I thought we should do something completely different from where it sounded like we were headed.A few minutes later, I further underscored my three points — reemphasizing one verbatim and nuancing another slightly — but still reiterating the same three points. And then I waited.After the discussion ended, we voted anonymously on which direction we should take, and the result was unanimously in favor of the decision I recommended.After the meeting closed, one of my mentors — a 30-year veteran — came to me with his hand outstretched to say, “Thank you for what you said. You changed my mind today.”When you can influence those that are more accomplished than you, more successful than you, and maybe even smarter than you to do what you think is right — that's when you've made it.What's the best career advice you ever received?\n        The best piece of advice I've ever been given is one from a professional mentor. He said I needed to “Stop trying to bat .600. If I aimed for .400, I'd be a better leader and team member because I would invite ways to make my ideas better.”At first, I was devastated by the advice. I hadn't been trying to bat .600 — I was trying to bat .800.It took a day to realize he was saying my power was in opening myself to being wrong more, not less.The shift was difficult because it required so much trust that my being “wrong” wouldn't be judged too harshly. And it required working with amazing leaders who did, in fact, provided space to make ideas better.When I accepted his advice and acted on it, it was the shift that unlocked my career.What's the best career advice you ever received?\n        The best advice I've ever received came from a male mentor when I first entered the middle-management stage of my marketing career. He told me about the importance of working for a company that respected and valued me for my authentic self. His advice was: “Ultimately, if you can't bring your full self to work, it's really not worth it.”As an ambitious, proud African American woman and the mother of young twins, I realized that my “business-only, buttoned-up, I'm at the top of my game, always polished” engagement with my mostly white male colleagues was actually emotionally draining.That year, I decided to openly share my challenges as a new parent, my career ambitions as one of the only Black women in marketing, my faith, and my love of sports as a former Division I track athlete with my colleagues.The true connections I was able to make that year actually propelled my career, and I still maintain many of those relationships today. I was promoted to VP of marketing that very next year. I'll never forget when my mother unexpectedly passed away in 2009 due to kidney failure. The entire executive leadership team of the company showed up for her funeral. They didn't just sign the book and leave, they stayed and met my personal friends and family members. Most importantly, they cared and were there to support me. This truly touched me during one of the most difficult times of my life, and it's one of the reasons I'm still with the company today. Is there anything you would do differently if you could go back to the beginning of your professional career? What is the lesson?\n        When I graduated from Brown University in the late 1980s, business-career opportunities working for Black-owned businesses or for organizations dedicated to helping improve the lives of African Americans were not promoted heavily. Careers in investment banking or consulting were valued much more.If I could go back to the beginning of my professional career, I would definitely broaden my career search to include both large and small Black-owned businesses and organizations with community-building missions. Young, talented people entering the workforce today can have a tremendous impact on the world.It's not always about how much money you make, it's about loving what you do and being able to make a difference. Our aspirations should not be limited and should include opportunities to serve.I eventually found my passion later on in my career, as I now lead global corporate communications and corporate social-responsibility efforts for a global company. Today, I help fund and support hundreds of organizations and causes, including those focused on economic empowerment and social justice. It's the most rewarding work I do.What's your best advice to young Black women and men who aspire to your level of power, influence, or paycheck?\n        It's important to understand that being a leader at this level entails much more than being skilled in your specialty. I often hear people say they want to be judged solely on the merits of their work. You're expected to know how to do the work — that skill set got you to your current level.To make the leap from middle to upper management and beyond, you must be able to demonstrate leadership skills. As you might expect, these include critical thinking, accountability, emotional intelligence, problem-solving, and the ability to communicate clearly, among others. These skills are useful at any level of your career but become even more critical in upper management and executive level positions.There are certain extraneous behaviors that are also crucial to those seeking to climb the corporate ladder. These behaviors are arguably more important in your journey because without them, it would be impossible to get on decision-makers' radars.Paramount on the list is making a name for yourself. Often referred to as personal branding, this describes how you show up. If you appear unapproachable, detached, or disengaged, you're unlikely to be sought out for coveted assignments and stretch projects, thereby losing the opportunity to be judged on the merits of your work.If others only know you by name because you spend the workday behind closed doors and only interact via email, you've lost an opportunity to gain one or more advocates. On the other hand, being fully present, having a positive attitude, and being confident — without being arrogant — will often draw others to you and allow them to observe your leadership skills on full display.Likewise, take advantage of opportunities to engage with decision-makers in informal settings. Too often employees refuse invitations to business events such as the annual holiday party or office retreat because they occur after hours. These events provide a unique opportunity to casually interact with decision-makers and potential advocates. Allowing them to see who you are in a relaxed setting can often work to your benefit.What's the best career advice you've ever received?\n        I've been lucky to have mentors who have given me great advice throughout my career. One that I always keep in mind is that you can't lead others effectively if you don't show genuine care for who they are, where they are in their career journey, and where they want to be.You have to really know the people you work with and commit to being part of the process of helping them grow.As a Black woman, when did you realize you had \"made it\" in a white, male-dominated corporate America?\n        I think one key to success for me is to never feel like I've “made it.” I certainly appreciate and celebrate my accomplishments, but then it's time for me to get back to work, find my next challenge, and stay relevant.As far as how I was able to navigate the less-than-diverse legal field and corporate boardrooms, I was very fortunate to have grown up in an atmosphere where I was extremely proud to be Black. I was very well aware of the discriminatory laws, policies, and attitudes that were hurdles for my parents, grandparents, older siblings, and extended family. And yet, they rose above them all with their heads held high, breaking barriers with a smile on their face and the knowledge that no one was better than them.As a result, I was never intimidated when I was the only woman or the only person of color in the room. My mere presence in the room is a victory for all those who helped clear the path for me. It is my job to demonstrate excellence once I am at the table so that my race and gender are only a backdrop to the value I bring to the organization.What's your best advice to young Black women and men who aspire to your level of power, influence, or paycheck?\n        There is an African proverb that says, “If you want to go fast, go alone. If you want to go far, go together.”Over the years, I've learned that the best success stories emerge when talented people with vision and a strong work ethic are supported by a “village” that makes it possible for them to be their best and most complete selves. Learning your strengths early and leaning into them — while cultivating opportunities to refine those areas where you might be lacking — is important. But equally important is your ability to build a strong team around you who can help make the space for you to perform to the utmost of your ability, whether they play a formal or informal role in your career trajectory. And once you've achieved your desired level of success, be sure to pay it forward.In the spirit of those who helped build and lift you up over the years, be sure that you're creating new opportunities for others. We can all benefit from a helping hand — even if we don't want to fully acknowledge or accept it — and there's great value in uplifting others, opening new doors, and paving new paths along our journeys.As you rise, be a mentor or a sponsor for others, and continue to seek out people who can do the same for you. Expand your village, including people who don't look like you or have a similar background. You never know where your strongest advocates will come from, and only time will tell who your best advocates will be. Know that you belong at any table where you want to be and that you should never doubt yourself or your abilities. The road to success is anything but linear, and you must remain open, persistent, willing to learn, and capable of getting up and dusting yourself off any time you don't succeed or fall short of the expectations you've set for yourself. Opportunities abound — if one door closes, find an open window to make your entrance. Shine bright and never give up.As a Black woman, when did you realize you had \"made it\" in a white, male-dominated corporate America? \n        I don't ever feel like I have “made it” in corporate America. There is always something to learn, someone to help. With that said, I recognize that as an officer of a Fortune 100 company, I have made it to a level that many Black women aspire to. I will know that I have contributed something when I see more people who look like me (and who don't — more diversity) sitting in C-level conversations. I measure my success in step functions of people I have helped, as well as business outcomes that were better as a result of my participation. I don't think I will ever feel like I have made it. I try to re-earn my offer letter every day.What's your best advice to young Black women and men who aspire to your level of power, influence, or paycheck? \n        Three words: Don't give up. Our climb looks different than others moving through corporate America. There have been times that I have been passed up for jobs that I knew I was qualified for. When that happened, I had to take a hard look at myself and ask myself where I could improve. Many times when I looked in the mirror, there were things that I needed to refine. Other times, I was experiencing the bias we all know is there in corporate America. I can look back over my career and remember those times, and it was devastating. The difference between those who move on and up comes in those who can recognize the bias and not wear it as a chip on the shoulder. They can be their own toughest critics and improve on the things they need to change. It's important to come from a place of knowing that the system can be unpredictable, but give each interaction, each job, each boss, each team a fresh start. And remember, sometimes it is you. If you are explaining everything that doesn't go your way as racism, sexism, or bias, you have some introspection to do.Is there anything you would do differently if you could go back to the beginning of your professional career? What is the lesson?\n        Don't be afraid to bring your unique gifts to the table. I remember getting the “Corporate America” or “Dealing with White People” speech when I was a young professional. Advice like: “They can go out for drinks after dinner, but that is not for you — don't get too comfortable.” That advice cost me valuable networking and relationship-building time. Whether or not I had a drink would be a personal choice, but I should have always taken the networking opportunity. Other advice kept me from taking well-earned vacation days and left me overworked and exhausted. I had to learn to tap in to my unique experience as a Black woman — the way I see things, the way I experience the world — and bring those to the workplace. There were so many times that I held back my point of view because it wasn't what everyone else was saying. But that is why I was there — we don't get the benefits of diversity if everyone shows up trying to fit in. With that said, it is important to understand the cultural environment of the company that you are in, but we all have a unique role to play in that culture. When I decided to be me, my whole life changed.What's the best career advice you ever received?\n        Receiving career advice that radically changes the trajectory of your life is uncommon. But that was my experience. I'd been working at UPS part time for two years while attending Temple University. My plan was to graduate and go into a master's program for psychology in Miami, where it was much warmer.My mentor knew I was potentially at risk of leaving UPS. He sat me down, and our talk caused me to rethink everything. My question was, “Why me at UPS?” His response? “Why not you?” It was that simple. He challenged me, and he believed in me. I told him I didn't see any Black UPS women in higher positions. He asked again, “Why not you?” Then he said something that has always stayed with me: “You have a great education. You obviously have learned the business. Believe in yourself. Understand you are good enough. Don't let the next person take advantage of something you're already imminently prepared for and in a position to make an impact on for the company. It doesn't matter whether someone out there looks like you. It really comes back to you. You have what it takes. But you have to make a decision. You need to decide if you think you can do it. If the answer is yes, then why not?” I'm proud to say I went on to drive a UPS delivery truck. People, especially little girls, often ran out to see me. They didn't know UPS had female drivers, let alone Black female drivers. I was trailblazing, and I've tackled a lot of firsts like that on the road to my current position as UPS chief diversity, equity, and inclusion officer.I'm eternally grateful I had a mentor who cared enough to push me to take a chance. I now know this is part of UPS's unique culture. We push our fellow UPSers to strive for greatness. By lifting each other, we give wings to the entire company. Looking in the rearview mirror at that advice and how it impacted my 32-year career and life, I think it worked out pretty well.What's the best career advice you ever received?\n        The best career advice I have received is that each one of us should be a bridge, working to find common ground and common goals. It is up to each one of us to start a conversation, deepen relationships, and be a part of the change we know is possible. True inclusion is a game changer for personal careers, organizations, and communities — and it starts with stronger relationships grounded in what we share and appreciation and respect for our differences. We can use and lend our power and privilege as a catalyst to create a better world for all of us. This is how we can accelerate our personal development and pay it forward to the next generation.Throughout my career, I've been very fortunate to have had meaningful relationships with women and men who believed in me and supported my career aspirations. In addition to mentors and sponsors, my sister circle inspires and challenges me — and I trust them to always tell me the truth. My experience has taught me how powerful meaningful, positive relationships are in accelerating personal development and career growth.It is important to expand your circle and reach out to those who may be different from you to learn from their experiences and insights. Build authentic, trusting relationships. We need to bridge the social-distance gap. Social distance, in this context, tends to be driven by the lack of engagement outside your personal environment. What we find is that the greatest distance tends to be between white men and women of color, but also between white women and women of color. When you have this social distance, many assumptions are made that can impede understanding and building of an authentic relationship. Expanding your circle allows for you to maximize your personal growth, while also expanding the growth of others.What's the best career advice you ever received?\n        \"You will be too much for some people. Those are not your people.\"I have been given a version of this advice (because I. Can. Be. A. Lot!), and I love that this advice now makes its way on the rounds of Pinterest and greeting cards.Sometimes we need to give ourselves permission to sort and sift the wide range of feedback we receive along our career journey. Don't get me wrong: It is vital to be coachable and open to developmental feedback. We all have mental muscles and leadership skills that need refinement if we hope to move forward and up in our careers. Because our own view can be obscured. And we don't have a clear and comprehensive perspective on our own strengths (let's say that louder for the people in the back: our strengths!) and our areas that could improve with some change.However, not every boss or leader who gives you advice and feedback is effective at the vital leadership skill of providing their employees thoughtful and helpful feedback. It takes practice. It is a learned skill. And sometimes the feedback you are given by another leader is more about that leader than it is about you. Too often, feedback is a reflection of leaders who only recognize their own strengths and style as the model.So sometimes you have to treat feedback like a pile of gifts from a white-elephant party. You can make the choice to keep what fits, throw the rest in the trash, and keep on moving.As a Black woman, when did you realize you had \"made it\" in a white, male-dominated corporate America?\n        I feel incredibly privileged to be a Black woman on Target's executive leadership team but also acknowledge that being in the C-suite isn't how I measure my success. I've learned from and been lifted up by those who came before me, including leaders, mentors, sponsors, trailblazers, and glass-ceiling breakers.It's my privilege and obligation to pay it forward by helping to create more opportunities for women, people of color, and other underrepresented populations, including the Black community I proudly represent.This happens by opening doors, adding more seats at the table, or, when required, creating our own table.What was the most challenging personal moment that illustrates the hardship of being a Black woman in corporate America?\n        The most challenging personal issue for me isn't a singular moment but rather the ongoing challenge of being constantly underestimated throughout my career. As a Black woman at the helm of a publicly traded company, I don't fit the profile of what most people envision as a chairman and CEO. I am underestimated in many situations, from my ability to drive operational execution and make the hard decisions to thinking strategically and responding appropriately to all of our stakeholders.What I would say to other Black and Latinx executives is that being underestimated can be a secret weapon. I continue to focus on what is right for the business. I make an intentional effort to not personalize any underestimation of my abilities, but rather shift my mindset and think of those who doubt my abilities or run a narrative of “can't do” about me or my team as an audience to educate about what it means to achieve and be successful despite the overwhelming odds.As a society, we have to educate and break through these biases. Diversity, both from a gender and racial standpoint, is the cornerstone to better financial outcomes and company cultures. The racial reckoning we've gone through this past year leaves me hopeful and optimistic for the progress of our nation, as I see more companies and individuals continuing to have these hard conversations and take action around eliminating racism and addressing biases.Is there anything you would do differently if you could go back to the beginning of your professional career? What is the lesson?\n        At the beginning of my career, I had a tendency to only speak up if I knew that my points were perfect and articulate. But I've learned my voice is powerful and I have important things to say. That question that you think is “stupid” is the one that might drive the conversation in the right direction. If you wait until you get the words right, you might miss your opportunity to be noticed, to advance your career, or to be heard.Don't let perfection be your enemy. Not every choice you make is going to be perfect. We all have a lot to learn. Growing, and growing together as organizations, teams, and colleagues, is what's important. Take calculated risks that sometimes involve failing. Just learn from it and move on.So if I'm honest, I wouldn't change a thing about my career. Our lives and careers are built on a series of choices. Some of my biggest choices were mistakes that occurred early in my career and got me where I am today. The key is not wasting your mistakes and imperfections. Learn from them and help others grow from your choices.Focus on being your personal best, which might not be perfect, but it will be authentic. Don't compete with others, but lift them up, and the rest will follow. Surround yourself with people who have your back and push you to be better. We are stronger and better together.What's your best advice to young Black women and men who aspire to your level of power, influence, or paycheck?\n        I have recently taken on a new role overseeing the financial performance and strategic direction for all of Northwestern Mutual's risk products — the first woman and first African American to do so — and this milestone prompted me to think about my journey and how I can continue to encourage those who are aspiring to follow a similar path.The fact is, there are so many variables that are outside your control, yet they can impact your career. One of the most important drivers of a successful career path is determined entirely by you — your mindset.How you approach your work and the world at large can open up new ways of seeing connections and opportunities. This often means being receptive to new routes along the way — many of the steps I have taken to get to this spot have come in an unexpected way, or outside of what my original “plan” was.To best capitalize on these moments of opportunity as they happen, you need to understand and embrace what sets you apart and what unique attributes you offer — not just work skills but life experience outside of the office as well. This can help differentiate you and allow you to jump on those unexpected moments of opportunity without hesitation.One trait that has helped me (and one I believe is salient advice for professionals at any level) is the ability to engage authentically. My perspective has grown and shifted so much, shaped by the genuine connections I have made over the course of my career and have helped get me to where I am today.As we continue to grapple with the impact of COVID-19 on our lives and our nation's long-deferred reckoning with racism keeps testing us to consider what's truly needed for positive change, it is even more important to practice being an authentic and empathetic leader.Understanding what makes you you and what you bring to the table will help ensure you are positioned to take on new, more challenging opportunities and become an influential force not just in your work but also in your community.Chart: Taylor Tyson","articleSection":"Strategy","isAccessibleForFree":false,"hasPart":[{"@type":"WebPageElement","isAccessibleForFree":false,"cssSelector":"[data-lock-content]"}]}

                  <div class="typography"><p class="response svelte-en2lo4">One of the most important roles I've had in my career was working as the deputy CIO of the White House under President Obama. The hiring process took nearly six months to work through due to the extensive interviews, vetting, and security reviews. As you can imagine, my anticipation and anxiety grew as each day passed and another hiring process milestone was reached. </p>
                    </div><div class="typography"><p class="response svelte-en2lo4">The day had come when I was to inform my current manager that I had accepted a new job and would be leaving. As I shared with him details about the role, he asked me how I felt. Nothing can describe the feeling of responsibility, influence, duty, uncertainty, and nervousness that I felt all at once. As I expressed that to him, he responded with, “That's great!” I was shocked and pretty taken aback by his response. </p>
                    </div><div class="typography"><p class="response svelte-en2lo4">It had been ingrained in me since childhood that you always have to appear to keep it together. Many times, we are told to put on a stoic exterior. Don't share weaknesses or vulnerabilities at work. But in that moment, I shared my truest feelings because I was leaving and had nothing to lose. </p>
                    </div><div class="typography"><p class="response svelte-en2lo4">After I gathered myself from his response, he continued with one of the best pieces of advice I have ever received. He said, “If you are nervous going to your next job, next project, or next opportunity, then it is the perfect opportunity for you. It means you will push yourself to give your all and be the best leader you can be.” </p>
                    </div><div class="typography"><p class="response svelte-en2lo4">Never before had I considered my uncertainty to be an asset nor how nervousness could be used as motivation. In a time where companies progress, technologies expand, and cultures evolve, it is OK to use our emotional consciousness to make us better and to drive us to great success.</p>

Many women and people of color intuitively understand that it's a difficult and nuanced explanation as to why that's so. Suffice it to say that it's rooted in an awareness that the lens through which the world assesses our performance is perhaps sharper and longer than the lens used to evaluate others. </p>

Any pride in my personal advancements to date has less to do with my accomplishments and more to do with the success of others. The impact I've had on the lives and professional journeys of young leaders, especially women, that extends beyond my tenure at Marriott is important to me. My purpose is to model and remind them that they have a voice, they are required to use it, and that it's not the destination that defines us, but the quality of the unique journey we create for ourselves that matters most. </p>
                    </div><div class="typography"><p class="response svelte-en2lo4">There's no greater honor and responsibility than to lead people, to develop an environment that inspires, motivates, and helps others unleash their talent and reach their full potential.

                    </div><div class="typography"><p class="response svelte-en2lo4">I had a mentor who was a partner at the firm, and I shared my experience and that I was considering leaving the company. The advice he gave me has stayed with me my whole career, and I have often shared this with people who have come to me for advice in similar situations. He said to me, “This manager of yours could leave the firm tomorrow, or next week or next month. Do you like this job? Are you learning? Are you growing? Never base a decision about your career on another person. That person could leave, be fired, change roles, and then you would have made a decision that was the wrong one for you and your career.”</p>
                    </div><div class="typography"><p class="response svelte-en2lo4">Sure enough, that manager was gone from the firm within a year. I learned that it is dangerous to both run to or away from opportunities based solely on who your current boss is. I have used that advice in a broader sense during my career in that I focus on making decisions about roles I take based on whether I feel they are additive to my skill set, progressive for my career, and that I like and believe in what I and the company are doing in the world.</p>

Earlier in my career, this advice would have positioned me to step out of my comfort zone.

Seek out mentors with balanced feedback — it helps to build your confidence early in your career.</p>

Get the best education you can in your area of interest. Be self-aware and understand and appreciate your self-worth. Don't let someone else define that for you. It is OK to stumble, but pick yourself up and keep going. Be flexible and willing to learn alternate methods to accomplish your goals. Being flexible does not equate to being weak. Remember that compromise is not a bad word. You can win the battle but lose the war, but giving up is the enemy of success.</p>
                    </div><div class="typography"><p class="response svelte-en2lo4">Those challenging moments were those when I felt invisible, when people looked beyond or through me. That behavior enabled me to pause, self-reflect, and move forward to engage with those who did not reciprocate the courtesy. Although I would not equate this behavior as a hardship of being a Black woman in corporate America, it is only a hardship if women retreat instead of continuing their journey.</p>
                    </div><div class="typography"><p class="response svelte-en2lo4">If I could go back to the beginning of my career, I am not sure that I would do anything differently. Each stage of growth was calculated and helped prepare me for my current role. I was blessed to have mentors, managers, and coworkers that supported me and recognized my talents and contributions. I have always had the support of family and was never told what I could not do. When I graduated from law school, my grandfather told me that I could make a difference in this world, and that is what I plan to continue to do. I'm not finished making a difference. “To whom much is given, much is expected.”</p>

                  <div class="typography"><p class="response svelte-en2lo4">If I could go back to the beginning of my professional career, I would define what success looks like to me. I would discover my purpose — my why — sooner, along with the value of building relationships.</p>

I was focused on chasing my next success, personally and professionally, but hadn't taken the time to clearly define it for myself. Doing so allows one to enjoy the journey and celebrate the achievements along the way.</p>
                    </div><div class="typography"><p class="response svelte-en2lo4">Taking ownership over one's goals is another nugget. Often, we look to others to help us achieve our goals, but we possess more power over our destiny than we realize. We need to have personal vision to achieve goals. Having a vision board can help. It allows one to clearly see and reflect on personal goals and the legacy you want. It also helps guide decisions and keeps one true to their purpose.</p>
                    </div><div class="typography"><p class="response svelte-en2lo4">My son, family, minorities that have come before me, and the next generation of leaders drives my purpose. I believe success is a gift, and I want to use my gift to improve the lives of others. I keep pictures in my office of family, historical pictures of our first store, and our founder and students who interned at Publix to keep me focused on what's important. They keep me grounded, and I recognize that it isn't about self — it's for a greater purpose. This provides reinforcement to persevere.</p>
                    </div><div class="typography"><p class="response svelte-en2lo4">Lastly, find a mentor, a sponsor, and protégés. These are all different people that are important for your journey. A sponsor assumes the role of speaking on your behalf. They often have a seat at the table and value the contributions you bring. They see your potential before you see it in yourself. A mentor is closer to you, meets with you regularly to advise and invest in your development. Having protégés allows you to invest in others, helping them grow and develop. A journey traveled with others is always more meaningful.</p>

                    </div><div class="typography"><p class="response svelte-en2lo4">The reality is it has taken companies too long to get women to the C-suite — especially women of color. For example, less than 7% of Fortune 500 CEOs are women, and only three are women of color.</p>
                    </div><div class="typography"><p class="response svelte-en2lo4">There are several reasons for this, including culture and the lack of a diverse pipeline. It's important to cultivate corporate cultures where inclusion and equity are not just programs or initiatives but are business imperatives that are built into the fabric of the way companies operate and how they hold themselves accountable. When inclusion and equity exist in corporate cultures, programs, policies, practices, and behaviors, you can build a more diverse pipeline.</p>
                    </div><div class="typography"><p class="response svelte-en2lo4">As I think about my own journey, there have been critical moments that I believe made a difference: when I moved to Asia and worked as a general manager, when I became the commercial vice president for Dow's largest business in the largest region, and when I became Dow's first ever chief inclusion officer reporting directly to the CEO.</p>
                    </div><div class="typography"><p class="response svelte-en2lo4">What may surprise you is that each of these opportunities was less about me climbing the corporate ladder and more about my leveraging my career to fulfill my life's purpose: make the biggest difference possible with the time I have on the planet. My career allowed me to maximize my influence to help as many people as possible, be a visible example (because representation matters), and utilize my position to open doors and provide opportunities for others.</p>
                    </div><div class="typography"><p class="response svelte-en2lo4">So, you ask, when did I realize I had “made it”? I would contend I haven't “made it” until everyone has a fair chance to compete, everyone feels and is included, and I look back at a pipeline that is robust, diverse, and represents all talent. In other words, I will not have “made it,” until we have all “made it."</p>

                  <div class="typography"><p class="response svelte-en2lo4">Well, my advice is not tied to an aspiration of pay or power but to an aspiration of purpose, which can take some time to discover.</p>
                    </div><div class="typography"><p class="response svelte-en2lo4">Focus on how you want to make a difference in this life. It's never too early to start the journey of discovering your purpose as the first step in being able to make a difference.</p>
                    </div><div class="typography"><p class="response svelte-en2lo4">Purpose is not discovered through your position but through living a life of authenticity, in both your career and your personal life. It took some time, but I discovered that my purpose is about creating positive change, which I've learned can only occur through the formation of rich and authentic relationships.</p>
                    </div><div class="typography"><p class="response svelte-en2lo4">Forming such relationships requires being bold enough to give of your heart and your soul. It means accepting vulnerability as a true human emotion, being courageous, and using your voice to have those difficult conversations.</p>
                    </div><div class="typography"><p class="response svelte-en2lo4">To do so may mean we risk how we are seen and heard and, ultimately, how we are accepted. It may also mean the risk of putting yourself in a lonely place because others are often not willing to go to that place of conflict where change happens.</p>
                    </div><div class="typography"><p class="response svelte-en2lo4">But vulnerability begets vulnerability, and courage begets courage. And I've learned that when our fellow colleagues — including the many white men in power — are willing to meet me on the bridge, it is courage that can move mountains and make beauty happen.</p>
                    </div><div class="typography"><p class="response svelte-en2lo4">Being a Black woman in corporate America is often excruciatingly lonely. But it is also empowering when I give all that I have and use my voice to speak up when so many others do not have the access to do so. So give of yourself, use your voice, be vulnerable and courageous. The positive change that can happen when you do so reaps rewards beyond measure.</p>

                    </p></div>
                  <div class="typography"><p class="response svelte-en2lo4">The best career advice has come from my female mentors, beginning with Ronke Bammeke, who urged me to pursue my MBA at Northwestern University's Kellogg School of Management, despite my concerns about moving so far away and leaving behind a promising career at Guaranty Trust Bank in Lagos, Nigeria.</p>
                    </div><div class="typography"><p class="response svelte-en2lo4">Ronke showed me the importance of taking a “bet” on myself and the power of embracing change — growth happens when you step out of your comfort zone. Her advice opened up the world to me: I spent a summer interning in Australia, and after graduation I worked and traveled extensively across North America and Europe as a consultant with McKinsey &amp; Co.</p>
                    </div><div class="typography"><p class="response svelte-en2lo4">I left McKinsey to take on my first P&amp;L role at BMO Harris Bank, where Sandra Hanington quickly became another mentor. Shortly after she hired me, a reorganization positioned me for a bigger role working for someone else. I hesitated, but Sandra reminded me of the importance of leaning into change and challenge.</p>
                    </div><div class="typography"><p class="response svelte-en2lo4">This mindset later gave me the confidence to question the status quo while developing new products and, four years ago, to leave a P&amp;L role to oversee operations. I sought operations experience for the enormous insight it has provided me into the heartbeat of the organization, leading the tens of thousands of colleagues who serve our clients every day. A willingness to embrace change again gave me the confidence last year to join Citi in the middle of a global pandemic.</p>
                    </div><div class="typography"><p class="response svelte-en2lo4">Stepping out of your comfort zone helps you learn something new, and over the years, it has kept me curious, energized, and humble. It has also helped me expand my network and created opportunities to broaden my impact as a leader.</p>
                    </div><div class="typography"><p class="response svelte-en2lo4">This is advice that I now share as a mentor. While many transitions come with some level of uncertainty and the risk of failure, you should feel confident in your abilities — and take that “bet” on yourself, knowing that if you put in the hard work, you can learn, adapt, and thrive through change.</p>

                    </div><div class="typography"><p class="response svelte-en2lo4">My best advice for young people is to tap into communities of support, recognize and embrace the importance of being confident and taking risks, don't be afraid to try, and don't be afraid to fail, because if you're afraid to fail, you will never try anything.</p>

                    </div><div class="typography"><p class="response svelte-en2lo4">As with, I'm sure, the rest of the world, 2020 was an incredibly challenging year for Zoox and myself personally.

                  <div class="typography"><p class="response svelte-en2lo4">Be coachable. From the start of my career, I found value in looking to my “board of directors” for insight and feedback. I'm referring to the close-knit inner circle who have helped me to make the right personal and professional decisions.</p>
                    </div><div class="typography"><p class="response svelte-en2lo4">My board of directors includes my husband and children, close friends, and others who share my values such as perseverance, resilience, and spiritual faith.</p>
                    </div><div class="typography"><p class="response svelte-en2lo4">I have achieved success by seeking input early and often from my personal board, and I trust their feedback. They believe in me, care about me, and challenge me to step outside my comfort zone, which has emboldened me to take risks and reach new heights in my career.</p>
                    </div><div class="typography"><p class="response svelte-en2lo4">Additionally, I don't take myself too seriously, and that keeps me grounded and real. I have written and own my narrative, and I make a conscious effort to stay positive, seek joy, and be grateful, empathetic and fun. </p>
                    </div><div class="typography"><p class="response svelte-en2lo4">So ask yourself: Who sits on your personal board of directors? Seek out the counsel of those who will encourage and support but also push and challenge you when you need it most. Be coachable.</p>
                    </div><div class="typography"><p class="response svelte-en2lo4">And be sure to give back as well. To be an effective member of someone else's personal board, you must share honestly the life lessons you've learned and encourage the development of deep, lasting relationships. Serve as a mentor, especially when your experiences enable you to make a difference, as I do with first-generation African American college students and graduates. </p>

                <div class="typography questionParent svelte-en2lo4"><p class="question svelte-en2lo4">Is there anything you would do differently if you could go back to the beginning of your professional career? What is the lesson?
                    </p></div>
                  <div class="typography"><p class="response svelte-en2lo4">I've learned many lessons throughout my career, and one that most resonates with me is the value of relationships. I grew up in an environment where I didn't have lawyers or corporate professionals to look up to or learn from. I had to learn the soft skills and unwritten rules of corporate America while I was on the job.</p>
                    </div><div class="typography"><p class="response svelte-en2lo4">Early on in my career, I didn't fully appreciate the importance of relationship building and networking. I thought that hard work was the surefire path to success and that your efforts will be recognized.</p>
                    </div><div class="typography"><p class="response svelte-en2lo4">The reality is that who you know is just as important — if not more important — than what you know. It's vital to focus on building and maintaining a presence outside of the office, because that's where you create the space for future opportunities. It's how you develop relationships with individuals, whether within or outside of your company, who make sure you're being included in conversations about high-potential talent, job opportunities, or speaking engagements.</p>
                    </div><div class="typography"><p class="response svelte-en2lo4">As an introvert, building these relationships required focus and intentionality. As a Black woman, I faced the additional challenge of not having people in my organization who looked like me.</p>
                    </div><div class="typography"><p class="response svelte-en2lo4">I received feedback that I was too reserved, and that isn't often seen as a trait for strong leadership. I soon learned that while you don't need to be an extrovert to succeed, you do need to develop relationships that will be critical to your success. For me, this involved stepping out of my comfort zone and forcing myself to engage with new and different people.</p>
                    </div><div class="typography"><p class="response svelte-en2lo4">It's important to identify your blind spots early and foster connections that you can tend to and grow over the course of your career. One way to do this is getting involved in associations where you can meet like-minded peers in your professional space. Taking on a leadership role will help you build even stronger connections in those spaces. Whether it's attending events, investing in a career coach, or finding a mentor or sponsor, I came to realize that early investment in relationship building is a game changer.</p>

                    </p></div>
                  <div class="typography"><p class="response svelte-en2lo4">When someone asks how I “made it,” I can honestly tell them I don't believe I have. One of my mentors taught me that you will never “arrive” if you're in continual pursuit of growth. If you think you're there, you definitely aren't, but you have probably lost sight of who you are. Who I am is always striving.</p>
                    </div><div class="typography"><p class="response svelte-en2lo4">I focus on servant leadership — giving more of myself for others than for my own gain. As a Black Jamaican Chinese woman, I stand on the shoulders of those who came before me in very real ways. I also carry the weight of a lot of people on my shoulders, but I've learned that it's OK to carry it. As a Black woman, I can't afford to make mistakes. If I do risk failure, I have to fail fast and recover faster — but I try to use that knowledge as fuel.</p>
                    </div><div class="typography"><p class="response svelte-en2lo4">Humility and grace remind me that carrying that weight is part of reaching a certain level of success — carrying that weight means performing a service I have earned for others. That can mean living with the pressure to always make a good first impression as a Black woman in business, knowing that the impression I leave may be imprinted on someone's mind as their definition of Black womanhood. Or it may mean dropping off snacks at a shelter for Black youth with my husband over the weekend, to help kids who haven't caught a break. It may even mean deciding to pray for detractors who may see me only through the damaging filter of their own prejudice, when they choose to see my mere presence as a threat.</p>
                    </div><div class="typography"><p class="response svelte-en2lo4">If humility is accepting that we can always push ourselves further, grace is seeking to understand the experiences of those around us — or when we can't understand them, to send them off on their journey, rather than engage in a toxic dialogue. As my mom taught me, grace reminds us of who we are and what life is all about, and I'll always be grateful for that.</p>

                  <div class="typography"><p class="response svelte-en2lo4">The best career advice I have gleaned has truly come from my lived experiences. It's a time to reflect on how and why something happened, then understand what you can do to be better prepared in the future.</p>
                    </div><div class="typography"><p class="response svelte-en2lo4">A defining moment in my career was when I was terminated from JCPenney in 2012 during a company repositioning. I had been working here for 34 years in various levels of responsibility, and while my performance was not in question, I was unexpectedly terminated from the company. I had grown up and relocated with this company, and this was the place that had provided me with many opportunities for growth.</p>
                    </div><div class="typography"><p class="response svelte-en2lo4">The termination gave me time to breathe and reflect. I learned that I had not been completely true to myself and had been operating under the “corporate mask.” I was eventually rehired by JCPenney — what I call “phase two” of my career — and since then, I have repositioned myself to be unapologetically me. This includes being transparent with my team, asking the questions others may not want to ask, fighting for what's right, and demonstrating vulnerability. The advice I give myself and others is: You have a chance every day to show up and be your authentic self — if it makes others uncomfortable, let them make the adjustment. That doesn't mean be rude or inappropriate; it means you deserve to operate without second-guessing your every move or filtering every thought because you're female or because you're Black.</p>
                    </div><div class="typography"><p class="response svelte-en2lo4">Upon my rehire, I put a mannequin in my office that remained undressed. That was my daily reminder to be authentic, don't get comfortable, and don't make others comfortable. In addition, that experience taught me to always be prepared for whatever twists and turns my career may take or decisions the company may make. We all perform better when we operate from a more authentic place and without fear of the future.</p>
                    </div><div class="typography"><p class="response svelte-en2lo4">I believe that everything does happen for a reason — fast-forward to today, and that growth period and experience prepared me for life's new challenges and being able to now navigate corporate life with a neurological disease that is impacting my vocals and mobility. It's a liberating place to be when your mindset and your preparedness allows you to just be you.</p>

                    </div><div class="typography"><p class="response svelte-en2lo4">I remember the encouragement of a close friend saying, "Cheryl, you have to do this. You have to go.”</p>
                    </div><div class="typography"><p class="response svelte-en2lo4">In order to succeed as a Black woman in corporate America, I felt a pull to get in earlier, stay later, work harder. I had made those sacrifices for my career over the years, but I didn't want to move. My friend insisted, “Leaving people behind is OK because you can help a new group of people now."</p>
                    </div><div class="typography"><p class="response svelte-en2lo4">So we left the house, but I didn't leave my people behind.</p>
                    </div><div class="typography"><p class="response svelte-en2lo4">For me, the decision to move allowed me to not only advance my career but also to inspire and support the next generation of people who look like me. It brought me to a company where I make an impact through my work. I see racial equity increase here because our leaders understand it's about more than just chasing a number: It's about changing a mindset. It's about putting the right people with the right skills in the right roles. </p>
                    </div><div class="typography"><p class="response svelte-en2lo4">If you look at corporate America, you'll see a few more people now who look like me, but how do we keep the momentum? In the era of remote work, we don't necessarily have to move away from home to make a difference. Instead, our role is to speak up to move people and companies out of their comfort zones. So let's keep moving forward, together.</p>

Once you have identified your careergoals, a sponsor can advocate for career advancement.</p>
                    </div><div class="typography"><p class="response svelte-en2lo4">Your board of directors can evolve. Your board will grow and change as your career aspirationsdevelop and/or you advance in your career.

                  <div class="typography"><p class="response svelte-en2lo4">I would tell these ambitious young men and women not to be consumed with a quest for personal success. Being successful is absolutely fulfilling, but I would ask these individuals to consider the definition of success, and more so how to get there.

                    </div><div class="typography"><p class="response svelte-en2lo4">In my experience, success, whatever your definition of it, is the result of three things.</p>
                    </div><div class="typography"><p class="response svelte-en2lo4">First is consistently doing the right thing, followed by working at the highest level of your personal ability and finally showing up each and every day with the goal to make an impact, whether that's in the lives of those around you or in your work. Success is a natural outcropping of these things. </p>
                    </div><div class="typography"><p class="response svelte-en2lo4">Ultimately, the real success — and satisfaction in it — comes from how you make a difference in the lives of people you lead, those that lead you, and the organization for which you work. It is impossible to rise to the top and achieve success without the inspired believers who are willing to serve alongside you to bring about change. You cultivate these inspired believers by making a difference in their lives and helping them fulfill their potential. That's how you find success.</p>

                  <div class="typography"><p class="response svelte-en2lo4">The best piece of career advice I ever received was that you need to be in the room even when you are not in the room.</p>
                    </div><div class="typography"><p class="response svelte-en2lo4">This was passed down to me by a female mentor who helped me early in my career. A former employer hosted a mentoring program that paired us with female leaders from other companies, so she was both wise in her counsel and not involved in the day-to-day business or politics of my company.</p>
                    </div><div class="typography"><p class="response svelte-en2lo4">She explained to me that most of the really important decisions about our careers are happening behind closed doors, so it's crucial to build a presence and a profile that will keep you top of mind with decision-makers even when not physically in front of them.</p>
                    </div><div class="typography"><p class="response svelte-en2lo4">To do this, you need to connect with — and become real to — as many leaders in your organization as possible. As my career progressed, I became extremely methodical and intentional about building relationships, regularly setting up meetings whether in my home office or another city or country. I went into the conversations eager to learn more about these leaders and found they were equally interested in learning more about me and my work.</p>
                    </div><div class="typography"><p class="response svelte-en2lo4">My natural tendency was to shy away from speaking about myself and my projects because I didn't want this to be seen as self-promotion. With time, and more conversations, it became clear that there was a double benefit to sharing my work. The people I met with offered new insights and fresh perspectives that made me better at my job, and they took away a deeper understanding of my capabilities and thought processes.</p>
                    </div><div class="typography"><p class="response svelte-en2lo4">Many people hate networking, but I deliberately sought out leaders who I admired and respected so the meetings always felt exciting for me rather than onerous. I always learned a huge amount about the company, my role, and the industries I worked within.</p>
                    </div><div class="typography"><p class="response svelte-en2lo4">Following this advice has paid dividends many times in my career. One of the most pivotal career breaks I ever received was from an executive who I had never met, who lived halfway around the world, but had received a recommendation from someone else I had connected with. When I got the call offering me a new role, it felt as if it came out of the blue, when, in fact, it came from my taking a methodical approach to being in the room even when I wasn't in the room.</p>
                    </div><div class="typography"><p class="response svelte-en2lo4">This piece of advice has been so powerful for me that regularly connecting with people whom I admire is something I do still to this day. I am less focused these days about doing this to advance my career and more focused on staying fresh in my own thinking and challenging my perspective.</p>

                  <div class="typography"><p class="response svelte-en2lo4">My advice to early career professionals, particularly young Black women and men, is first and foremost to do your current job well. The most reliable way to advance is to demonstrate a track record of high performance.</p>
                    </div><div class="typography"><p class="response svelte-en2lo4">The next most important aspect of advancement is to make yourself replaceable. Developing strong successors enables you to take advantage of opportunities that may arise.</p>
                    </div><div class="typography"><p class="response svelte-en2lo4">The last piece of the puzzle for moving up the ladder is forgetting about the ladder. Every move doesn't have to be straight toward the top. Lateral moves can be great ways to broaden your skill set and gain business experience. Plus, working in different areas of the company can help you increase your organizational empathy and create more optionality for career growth. </p>
                    </div><div class="typography"><p class="response svelte-en2lo4">I also encourage young Black professionals to be authentic at work. Authenticity is critical to creating trust in the workplace, but it's often easier said than done. It may be challenging to show up as our true selves, but people have to know you to trust you. I have also found that talking about ourselves and our experiences is what makes an inclusive and engaged workforce.</p>
                    </div><div class="typography"><p class="response svelte-en2lo4">Finally, make time to prioritize self-care. I am a big believer that to keep from feeling out of balance, it is essential to make time for yourself and to invest in your friendships. Having friends who show up for you, and who count on you to show up for them, helps to keep it all in perspective.</p>

                    </p></div>
                  <div class="typography"><p class="response svelte-en2lo4">There is no simple piece of advice that solves the Black experience. It's complex. What I have come to understand is that embracing your difference can be a source of power. I grew up with a mother who was often the “only.” She was the first person in her family to start a business and one of a few women who worked outside the home. I learned from her how to be at peace with tension, how to navigate adversity, and how to thrive when going against the grain. As a Black woman in tech, I have lived through my own set of “only” experiences. Constantly having to orient my world view to that of others, a spotlight always shined on me. It wasn't always a good one and not one I asked for. There was also plenty of rejection and isolation. The first few times it felt awful — walking away is not easy and, of course, you can't walk away from yourself. I realized that moving forward meant going against the grain, so I embraced the habits I had formed to manage my differences, using my ability to see both sides of a problem to become a stronger negotiator, empathetic leadership to curate people with difference, always stirring the pot, and pushing others to join me in the constructive tension where innovation flourishes. Seeking out opportunities to go against the grain even further, great personal satisfaction and professional success is found when taking the most underserved, undervalued segments and turning them to significance. Whether advocating for female entrepreneurs, going overseas to emerging markets or taking complex jobs, I raise my hand for opportunities to stay uncomfortable. Most importantly, I make sure to be chasing more: to do meaningful work, to give back, to contribute. Purpose sustains passion; passion fuels success. My mother was resilient. She went against all the norms, with plenty of failings along the way. Each one was a learning that widened the net for me. I hope my experiences will cast the net even further giving the next generation the courage to take bold risks and embrace their “only."</p>

                <div class="typography questionParent svelte-en2lo4"><p class="question svelte-en2lo4">What was the most challenging personal moment that illustrates the hardship of being a Black woman in corporate America?
                    </p></div>
                  <div class="typography"><p class="response svelte-en2lo4">The question presupposes one defining experience. But for me and many others, it has been a smorgasbord of negative experiences which start at a young age. This includes outsize discipline or criticism for behavior frequently exhibited by children in the majority and low expectations coupled with moments of shock and awe when mundane tasks are accomplished. Unfortunately, these are experiences I now relive through my two sons. There were variations on this theme throughout my education.</p>
                    </div><div class="typography"><p class="response svelte-en2lo4">When I moved into professional life, certain undermining experiences occurred with frequency: (1) having my counterpart speak directly to my subordinate (usually a white male) assuming he was the decision-maker when I, the Black woman, was; (2) being mistaken for support staff; (3) receiving looks of confusion when I stated my title. These are but a few examples.</p>
                    </div><div class="typography"><p class="response svelte-en2lo4">On my first day as an Assistant United States Attorney in Manhattan, I went to court to watch another AUSA complete an arraignment proceeding. When I began to introduce myself to my colleague, he barely made eye contact and directed me to another table. He then asked that I provide a report on the defendant. My confusion led to his frustration, and he sharply asked again. “I am a new AUSA,” I explained, “and I am here to watch you do an arraignment.” “Oh, sorry, then I guess you should sit over by me at the government's table,” he responded with surprise. </p>
                    </div><div class="typography"><p class="response svelte-en2lo4">This experience may seem minor, but some iteration of that moment where people assumed I was anything but an AUSA happened so regularly over the course of my tenure that I didn't have the luxury of outrage. Rather, I used these experiences to identify true allies and we focused our energy on supporting each other.</p>
                    </div><div class="typography"><p class="response svelte-en2lo4">Why articulate these challenging personal moments? Two reasons. </p>
                    </div><div class="typography"><p class="response svelte-en2lo4">First, to highlight how commonplace these slights and diminutions are and to show that despite the hurt they cause, ultimately, they are not determinative if and only if we surround ourselves with allies, supporters, and those that help sustain us. </p>
                    </div><div class="typography"><p class="response svelte-en2lo4">Second, to speak directly to other Black women who have had similar experiences — a sort of Michelle Obama/Kamala Harris “finger-point” moment — I see you, I am here, now go out and be great because you are.</p>

                  <div class="typography"><p class="response svelte-en2lo4">The best piece of career advice I've received came from a mentor when I was beginning my journey in the legal profession. It was to remember to keep my eyes on the horizon: A career path isn't always linear, but if I continue to deliver top-notch work product and keep the ship pointed in the right direction, the hard work will pay off.</p>
                    </div><div class="typography"><p class="response svelte-en2lo4">If it hadn't been for that advice, I might not have gotten into privacy. It was a fairly new field at the time, and many were surprised that I would leave a more senior position to take a more junior position in a lesser-known area of law. “Why would you want to do that?” was a common question people asked. But I was excited about the challenge, willing to put in the work, and ready to expand my skill set. Most importantly, I believed that no matter what, the direction was a good one and that the path would serve me well. All these years later, the field continues to be incredibly simulating, and the continued hard work has led to multiple opportunities for advancement. And I still look forward to the horizon.</p>

                  <div class="typography"><p class="response svelte-en2lo4">The best advice I ever received was to take risks and embrace challenging roles. Too often, we tend to stay in our comfort zones, focusing on jobs that are familiar and aligned to our current skills. One of my mentors encouraged me to never take the easy way out. It's OK to be slightly scared of a daunting challenge, which is a mindset that has guided me throughout my career. </p>
                    </div><div class="typography"><p class="response svelte-en2lo4">Taking risks comes in many forms. I've accepted roles that have required me to lead widespread change across an organization, implement new and progressive talent strategies, and fix organizational deficiencies.</p>
                    </div><div class="typography"><p class="response svelte-en2lo4">As a Black female leader, I've also embraced joining organizations in which there were few people of color in senior management.

                    </div><div class="typography"><p class="response svelte-en2lo4">I also believe that mission-driven organizations provide depth to my work, knowing that I am contributing to goals that seek to improve society. This was one of the main reasons I was attracted to my current role as chief human-resources officer at UnitedHealth Group. Looking back now at my first year with the company, the challenge of supporting a global healthcare workforce of 330,000 during a pandemic certainly was the ultimate stretch assignment.</p>
                    </div><div class="typography"><p class="response svelte-en2lo4">From a personal standpoint, I've learned to be comfortable with being a pioneer of new ideas, making bold decisions that may conflict with conventional views, and staying true to my belief system. I've had the chance to relocate eight times over the course of 25 years for the right opportunities. When you accept the vulnerability that comes from taking risks and being uncomfortable, it can lead to rewarding growth — professionally and personally.</p>

And with that, you'll be able to withstand the challenges of feeling that even though your looks might set you apart from others, knowing your value is your truth, your center.

                  <div class="typography"><p class="response svelte-en2lo4">I'm originally from Tanzania, where my family lived in poverty. Our home had no running water, electricity, windows, or doors. I worked incredibly hard in school and was one of two students in the country selected to attend an international high school in Norway. I then received a scholarship to attend Mount Holyoke College in the US, and while in college, I interned at Merrill through SEO, an organization that helps diverse students secure internships on Wall Street and other top companies. SEO is a great organization that I continue to support today.</p>

                  <div class="typography"><p class="response svelte-en2lo4">There are many personal moments to which I can point that illustrate the hardships of being a Black woman in corporate America. While the marks left from these moments are often indelible, put into perspective and in isolation, many of these moments could be considered rather insignificant. The true hardship and stress can come from the persistence and the aggregation of these moments/microaggressions over time.</p>
                    </div><div class="typography"><p class="response svelte-en2lo4">One such microaggression is that of mistaken identity. In a prior role, my organization would host annual events for our executive clients. As one of the senior leaders on the team, I was expected to attend the events along with my peers and my boss, the division president. During the welcome dinner for one of the sessions, a customer approached me and said, “You're who answers the phone when I call. Nice to finally meet you!” I knew I had never spoken to this person before, and in that moment I realized he had mistaken me for my boss' administrative assistant. As the only Black woman in the room, I did not fit the description of an “executive,” so I had to be something other than.</p>
                    </div><div class="typography"><p class="response svelte-en2lo4">This certainly was not the first time in corporate America that I had been mistaken for something other than an executive, and it would not be the last. As a Black female executive, it can be challenging to assume my rightful place in the room when I am not who others expect. The hardship is not created the first time nor the last time this happens — it is all of the times added together. However, strength and motivation are often born out of hardship. These moments teach me that my role as a leader is less likely to be presumed and I have to be confident enough in who I am to assume that rightful place whether others expect me there or not.</p>

                  <div class="typography"><p class="response svelte-en2lo4">Early in my career, I was selected to be part of a development program and was thrilled to be part of this elite group. But I quickly learned my inclusion was not welcomed by the program leader. Comments like “you need extra help” or “you are lucky to be here” were frequently mentioned. They were always said privately, accompanied by a feigned smile. </p>
                    </div><div class="typography"><p class="response svelte-en2lo4">I soon discovered similar comments had been said to another woman, a Mexican woman, whom I will call Anna. It did not take much time for Anna and me to form a strong friendship, and we decided to complete a required make-or-break project as part of this program. We worked diligently for months and had mentors who were always willing to hear our ideas, answer questions, and provide guidance. We were confident our proposal was sound.</p>
                    </div><div class="typography"><p class="response svelte-en2lo4">Judging our plan was a panel of executives. During our pitch, we answered every tough question. At the end, drenched in anticipation and pride, the oddest thing happened. The panel met privately, came back, and decided that our proposal needed to be fact-checked.</p>
                    </div><div class="typography"><p class="response svelte-en2lo4">Anticipation and pride were replaced by shock. I remember wondering if I had heard them correctly. Of course, we knew this was our work, down to the selection of the baby-blue cover sheets and 2-inch spiral binder. We quickly came to discover ours was the only pitch questioned. </p>
                    </div><div class="typography"><p class="response svelte-en2lo4">Ultimately, the truth prevailed. The panel confirmed the business plan was ours. We later learned through a source that our pitch was one of the best seen in years: redemption — you would think. Nonetheless, this event damaged our confidence and sense of worth.</p>

                  <div class="typography"><p class="response svelte-en2lo4">“Ask for what you want to get what you need.”</p>
                    </div><div class="typography"><p class="response svelte-en2lo4">My whole career changed when I put this advice into practice. I had worked in human resources for many years, rising to vice president and overseeing HR efforts for Constellation's commercial retail and wholesale businesses and enterprise risk management for Exelon. I was comfortable in my craft, solid in my skills. But I got the itch to stretch myself, to move into the business side of the organization and try something new.</p>
                    </div><div class="typography"><p class="response svelte-en2lo4">What if I failed? The thought of it made me feel unsettled and uncomfortable. Choosing success can be scary.

                    </div><div class="typography"><p class="response svelte-en2lo4">And then I asked for what I wanted. I told the CEO and president of retail I was ready to move into a business role. Within a few months, I was leading BGE Home as president and CEO. My career has continued to grow from there, with the help of my community of family, friends, and sponsors who were willing to place bets on me and strong relationships with people of different backgrounds, experiences, and perspectives.</p>
                    </div><div class="typography"><p class="response svelte-en2lo4">As professional men and women of color, we can't hope that if we put our heads down and work really hard people will simply notice it and make great things happen for us. It just doesn't work that way. So ask for that assignment. Ask for help when you need it. Ask for career development, expanded roles, and compensation commensurate with your contributions. Don't let discomfort disable you. Speak up — closed mouths don't get fed.</p>
                    </div><div class="typography"><p class="response svelte-en2lo4">And dream big. As Ellen Johnson Sirleaf, the first woman president of Liberia, famously said, “If your dreams do not scare you, they are not big enough.” Now go out, be great, and slay.</p>

I look back and realize that at times.

I have learned to believe that while I may not have all the answers, I start from a place of wisdom. I am a collection of all my experiences, and I have the will and tenacity to be anything I put my mind to.</p>
                    </div><div class="typography"><p class="response svelte-en2lo4">I also learned that my network was critical. They supported me, partnered with me, and many times were my advocate or sponsor. Earlier in my career, I did not appreciate that your network requires nourishing. It requires you to give as much as you take. Your network should be complex, diverse, and inclusive. It should include those at different levels, different backgrounds, and varying race and gender. A strong network makes you better because you learn from them as they learn from you. Life doesn't always introduce you to the people you want to meet. Sometimes life brings you people who will help you turn into the person you were meant to become.</p>

And don't forget that when you have the opportunity to help, to support, to promote, to be kind, do so.</p>

                  <div class="typography"><p class="response svelte-en2lo4">As I reflect on my career journey, there are many moments when I've experienced the hardship of being a Black woman in America. In two of those moments for me — one very early in my career and the other much later — I was treated the same way. Why? Because no matter how successful I had become, I was still a Black woman.</p>
                    </div><div class="typography"><p class="response svelte-en2lo4">The first occurred when I was a new lawyer. I was about to take my first deposition and arrived at the opposing law firm's office. As I arrived in the room with the other lawyers, one of the white male partners in the firm said to me, “Oh, good. I'm glad you're here. Can you get us all coffee?” I was stunned as I awkwardly explained that I was the lawyer taking the deposition, not an assistant. After the deposition was over, I pulled the partner aside and explained to him how inappropriate his assumption was and how it made me feel. He was shocked and extremely apologetic.</p>
                    </div><div class="typography"><p class="response svelte-en2lo4">Twenty years later, I was promoted to a high-level position at a major Fortune 500 company, which came with exclusive executive parking-garage perks. As I drove up, the white male parking attendant literally laughed in my face as he explained multiple times that I needed to go to the other parking garage because this one was for the “higher-ups.” His clear implication was there was no way I was one of the “higher-ups.” A week later, I found myself in his boss' office, where he uncomfortably apologized to me while his boss tried to justify his behavior by blaming the situation on a paperwork mix-up.</p>
                    </div><div class="typography"><p class="response svelte-en2lo4">Most Black women in corporate America endure this type of disrespect frequently, judiciously determining which battles to fight and which ones to swallow, and yet we still manage to lift up our chins, put our feelings aside, and perform excellent work. These experiences build strength and resilience in Black women; however, I hope that through navigating and sharing these encounters, we are also educating the ignorant and shifting their perception of what a corporate executive looks like in America.</p>

Too often, I think young professionals can feel pressured to take the “right” path toward growing their career. This is particularly true for women and young professionals of color who may feel pressured to tick off certain boxes in order to achieve success commensurate with their white male peers. </p>

But rather than become a professor or pursue my law degree, I decided I was going to go the business route, and I worked at a company that sold nuts, bolts, and screws (wearing steel-toed boots every day).

                  <div class="typography"><p class="response svelte-en2lo4">I offer three pieces of advice for young Black people entering the workforce — be your own advocate, have a strong network of mentors, and embrace who you are.</p>
                    </div><div class="typography"><p class="response svelte-en2lo4">Advocating for yourself is crucial.

                    </div><div class="typography"><p class="response svelte-en2lo4">As far as mentorship goes, everyone needs allies and truth tellers you can trust and connect with on a personal and professional level. My father was an incredible mentor for me early in my career, and I learned this lesson from him, which has been core to my career journey — and priceless. I have made a conscious effort to pass this sage advice forward wherever I've been able.</p>
                    </div><div class="typography"><p class="response svelte-en2lo4">Lastly, it's not often that I am at a table with others who look like me. It's hard to articulate how that feels, but what it has manifested for me is resiliency, a strong sense of personal agency, and a desire to sponsor and support other Black women on their career journey. My advice is to make career choices that will help you remain true to who you are — your style, personality, values, and experiences are unique. Do not shy away from who you are for a job.</p>
                    </div><div class="typography"><p class="response svelte-en2lo4">One of the things I value about Nordstrom is that we are an organization that fosters a culture of belonging for all employees, and we have recently announced goals to increase diversity throughout all parts of our company — from the brands we carry to the talent we hire and promote.</p>

                  <div class="typography"><p class="response svelte-en2lo4">The best advice I've ever received came from a male mentor when I first entered the middle-management stage of my marketing career. He told me about the importance of working for a company that respected and valued me for my authentic self. His advice was: “Ultimately, if you can't bring your full self to work, it's really not worth it.”</p>
                    </div><div class="typography"><p class="response svelte-en2lo4">As an ambitious, proud African American woman and the mother of young twins, I realized that my “business-only, buttoned-up, I'm at the top of my game, always polished” engagement with my mostly white male colleagues was actually emotionally draining.</p>
                    </div><div class="typography"><p class="response svelte-en2lo4">That year, I decided to openly share my challenges as a new parent, my career ambitions as one of the only Black women in marketing, my faith, and my love of sports as a former Division I track athlete with my colleagues.</p>
                    </div><div class="typography"><p class="response svelte-en2lo4">The true connections I was able to make that year actually propelled my career, and I still maintain many of those relationships today. I was promoted to VP of marketing that very next year. I'll never forget when my mother unexpectedly passed away in 2009 due to kidney failure. The entire executive leadership team of the company showed up for her funeral. They didn't just sign the book and leave, they stayed and met my personal friends and family members. Most importantly, they cared and were there to support me. This truly touched me during one of the most difficult times of my life, and it's one of the reasons I'm still with the company today.</p>
                    </div><div class="typography questionParent svelte-en2lo4"><p class="question svelte-en2lo4"> Is there anything you would do differently if you could go back to the beginning of your professional career? What is the lesson?
                    </p></div>
                  <div class="typography"><p class="response svelte-en2lo4">When I graduated from Brown University in the late 1980s, business-career opportunities working for Black-owned businesses or for organizations dedicated to helping improve the lives of African Americans were not promoted heavily. Careers in investment banking or consulting were valued much more.</p>
                    </div><div class="typography"><p class="response svelte-en2lo4">If I could go back to the beginning of my professional career, I would definitely broaden my career search to include both large and small Black-owned businesses and organizations with community-building missions. Young, talented people entering the workforce today can have a tremendous impact on the world.</p>
                    </div><div class="typography"><p class="response svelte-en2lo4">It's not always about how much money you make, it's about loving what you do and being able to make a difference. Our aspirations should not be limited and should include opportunities to serve.</p>
                    </div><div class="typography"><p class="response svelte-en2lo4">I eventually found my passion later on in my career, as I now lead global corporate communications and corporate social-responsibility efforts for a global company. Today, I help fund and support hundreds of organizations and causes, including those focused on economic empowerment and social justice. It's the most rewarding work I do.</p>

                    </p></div>
                  <div class="typography"><p class="response svelte-en2lo4">It's important to understand that being a leader at this level entails much more than being skilled in your specialty. I often hear people say they want to be judged solely on the merits of their work. You're expected to know how to do the work — that skill set got you to your current level.</p>
                    </div><div class="typography"><p class="response svelte-en2lo4">To make the leap from middle to upper management and beyond, you must be able to demonstrate leadership skills. As you might expect, these include critical thinking, accountability, emotional intelligence, problem-solving, and the ability to communicate clearly, among others. These skills are useful at any level of your career but become even more critical in upper management and executive level positions.</p>
                    </div><div class="typography"><p class="response svelte-en2lo4">There are certain extraneous behaviors that are also crucial to those seeking to climb the corporate ladder. These behaviors are arguably more important in your journey because without them, it would be impossible to get on decision-makers' radars.</p>
                    </div><div class="typography"><p class="response svelte-en2lo4">Paramount on the list is making a name for yourself. Often referred to as personal branding, this describes how you show up. If you appear unapproachable, detached, or disengaged, you're unlikely to be sought out for coveted assignments and stretch projects, thereby losing the opportunity to be judged on the merits of your work.</p>
                    </div><div class="typography"><p class="response svelte-en2lo4">If others only know you by name because you spend the workday behind closed doors and only interact via email, you've lost an opportunity to gain one or more advocates. On the other hand, being fully present, having a positive attitude, and being confident — without being arrogant — will often draw others to you and allow them to observe your leadership skills on full display.</p>
                    </div><div class="typography"><p class="response svelte-en2lo4">Likewise, take advantage of opportunities to engage with decision-makers in informal settings. Too often employees refuse invitations to business events such as the annual holiday party or office retreat because they occur after hours. These events provide a unique opportunity to casually interact with decision-makers and potential advocates. Allowing them to see who you are in a relaxed setting can often work to your benefit.</p>

Learning your strengths early and leaning into them — while cultivating opportunities to refine those areas where you might be lacking — is important. But equally important is your ability to build a strong team around you who can help make the space for you to perform to the utmost of your ability, whether they play a formal or informal role in your career trajectory.

                  <div class="typography"><p class="response svelte-en2lo4">I don't ever feel like I have “made it” in corporate America. There is always something to learn, someone to help. With that said, I recognize that as an officer of a Fortune 100 company, I have made it to a level that many Black women aspire to. I will know that I have contributed something when I see more people who look like me (and who don't — more diversity) sitting in C-level conversations. I measure my success in step functions of people I have helped, as well as business outcomes that were better as a result of my participation. I don't think I will ever feel like I have made it. I try to re-earn my offer letter every day.</p>

                    </p></div>
                  <div class="typography"><p class="response svelte-en2lo4">Three words: Don't give up. Our climb looks different than others moving through corporate America. There have been times that I have been passed up for jobs that I knew I was qualified for. When that happened, I had to take a hard look at myself and ask myself where I could improve. Many times when I looked in the mirror, there were things that I needed to refine. Other times, I was experiencing the bias we all know is there in corporate America. I can look back over my career and remember those times, and it was devastating. The difference between those who move on and up comes in those who can recognize the bias and not wear it as a chip on the shoulder. They can be their own toughest critics and improve on the things they need to change. It's important to come from a place of knowing that the system can be unpredictable, but give each interaction, each job, each boss, each team a fresh start. And remember, sometimes it is you. If you are explaining everything that doesn't go your way as racism, sexism, or bias, you have some introspection to do.</p>
                    </div><div class="typography questionParent svelte-en2lo4"><p class="question svelte-en2lo4">Is there anything you would do differently if you could go back to the beginning of your professional career? What is the lesson?
                    </p></div>
                  <div class="typography"><p class="response svelte-en2lo4">Don't be afraid to bring your unique gifts to the table. I remember getting the “Corporate America” or “Dealing with White People” speech when I was a young professional. Advice like: “They can go out for drinks after dinner, but that is not for you — don't get too comfortable.” That advice cost me valuable networking and relationship-building time. Whether or not I had a drink would be a personal choice, but I should have always taken the networking opportunity. Other advice kept me from taking well-earned vacation days and left me overworked and exhausted. I had to learn to tap in to my unique experience as a Black woman — the way I see things, the way I experience the world — and bring those to the workplace. There were so many times that I held back my point of view because it wasn't what everyone else was saying. But that is why I was there — we don't get the benefits of diversity if everyone shows up trying to fit in. With that said, it is important to understand the cultural environment of the company that you are in, but we all have a unique role to play in that culture. When I decided to be me, my whole life changed.</p>

I'd been working at UPS part time for two years while attending Temple University. My plan was to graduate and go into a master's program for psychology in Miami, where it was much warmer.</p>
                    </div><div class="typography"><p class="response svelte-en2lo4">My mentor knew I was potentially at risk of leaving UPS. He sat me down, and our talk caused me to rethink everything. My question was, “Why me at UPS?” His response? “Why not you?” It was that simple. He challenged me, and he believed in me. I told him I didn't see any Black UPS women in higher positions. He asked again, “Why not you?” Then he said something that has always stayed with me: “You have a great education. You obviously have learned the business. Believe in yourself. Understand you are good enough. Don't let the next person take advantage of something you're already imminently prepared for and in a position to make an impact on for the company. It doesn't matter whether someone out there looks like you. It really comes back to you. You have what it takes. But you have to make a decision. You need to decide if you think you can do it. If the answer is yes, then why not?” </p>
                    </div><div class="typography"><p class="response svelte-en2lo4">I'm proud to say I went on to drive a UPS delivery truck. People, especially little girls, often ran out to see me. They didn't know UPS had female drivers, let alone Black female drivers. I was trailblazing, and I've tackled a lot of firsts like that on the road to my current position as UPS chief diversity, equity, and inclusion officer.</p>
                    </div><div class="typography"><p class="response svelte-en2lo4">I'm eternally grateful I had a mentor who cared enough to push me to take a chance. I now know this is part of UPS's unique culture. We push our fellow UPSers to strive for greatness. By lifting each other, we give wings to the entire company. Looking in the rearview mirror at that advice and how it impacted my 32-year career and life, I think it worked out pretty well.</p>

                  <div class="typography"><p class="response svelte-en2lo4">The best career advice I have received is that each one of us should be a bridge, working to find common ground and common goals. It is up to each one of us to start a conversation, deepen relationships, and be a part of the change we know is possible. True inclusion is a game changer for personal careers, organizations, and communities — and it starts with stronger relationships grounded in what we share and appreciation and respect for our differences. We can use and lend our power and privilege as a catalyst to create a better world for all of us. This is how we can accelerate our personal development and pay it forward to the next generation.</p>

My experience has taught me how powerful meaningful, positive relationships are in accelerating personal development and career growth.</p>
                    </div><div class="typography"><p class="response svelte-en2lo4">It is important to expand your circle and reach out to those who may be different from you to learn from their experiences and insights. Build authentic, trusting relationships. We need to bridge the social-distance gap. Social distance, in this context, tends to be driven by the lack of engagement outside your personal environment. What we find is that the greatest distance tends to be between white men and women of color, but also between white women and women of color. When you have this social distance, many assumptions are made that can impede understanding and building of an authentic relationship. Expanding your circle allows for you to maximize your personal growth, while also expanding the growth of others.</p>

                    </div><div class="typography"><p class="response svelte-en2lo4">Sometimes we need to give ourselves permission to sort and sift the wide range of feedback we receive along our career journey. Don't get me wrong: It is vital to be coachable and open to developmental feedback. We all have mental muscles and leadership skills that need refinement if we hope to move forward and up in our careers. Because our own view can be obscured. And we don't have a clear and comprehensive perspective on our own strengths (let's say that louder for the people in the back: our strengths!) and our areas that could improve with some change.</p>
                    </div><div class="typography"><p class="response svelte-en2lo4">However, not every boss or leader who gives you advice and feedback is effective at the vital leadership skill of providing their employees thoughtful and helpful feedback. It takes practice. It is a learned skill. And sometimes the feedback you are given by another leader is more about that leader than it is about you. Too often, feedback is a reflection of leaders who only recognize their own strengths and style as the model.</p>
                    </div><div class="typography"><p class="response svelte-en2lo4">So sometimes you have to treat feedback like a pile of gifts from a white-elephant party. You can make the choice to keep what fits, throw the rest in the trash, and keep on moving.</p>

As a Black woman at the helm of a publicly traded company, I don't fit the profile of what most people envision as a chairman and CEO.

                    </p></div>
                  <div class="typography"><p class="response svelte-en2lo4">At the beginning of my career, I had a tendency to only speak up if I knew that my points were perfect and articulate. But I've learned my voice is powerful and I have important things to say. That question that you think is “stupid” is the one that might drive the conversation in the right direction. If you wait until you get the words right, you might miss your opportunity to be noticed, to advance your career, or to be heard.</p>
                    </div><div class="typography"><p class="response svelte-en2lo4">Don't let perfection be your enemy. Not every choice you make is going to be perfect. We all have a lot to learn. Growing, and growing together as organizations, teams, and colleagues, is what's important. Take calculated risks that sometimes involve failing. Just learn from it and move on.</p>
                    </div><div class="typography"><p class="response svelte-en2lo4">So if I'm honest, I wouldn't change a thing about my career. Our lives and careers are built on a series of choices. Some of my biggest choices were mistakes that occurred early in my career and got me where I am today. The key is not wasting your mistakes and imperfections. Learn from them and help others grow from your choices.</p>
                    </div><div class="typography"><p class="response svelte-en2lo4">Focus on being your personal best, which might not be perfect, but it will be authentic. Don't compete with others, but lift them up, and the rest will follow. Surround yourself with people who have your back and push you to be better. We are stronger and better together.</p>

                    </p></div>
                  <div class="typography"><p class="response svelte-en2lo4">I have recently taken on a new role overseeing the financial performance and strategic direction for all of Northwestern Mutual's risk products — the first woman and first African American to do so — and this milestone prompted me to think about my journey and how I can continue to encourage those who are aspiring to follow a similar path.</p>
                    </div><div class="typography"><p class="response svelte-en2lo4">The fact is, there are so many variables that are outside your control, yet they can impact your career. One of the most important drivers of a successful career path is determined entirely by you — your mindset.</p>
                    </div><div class="typography"><p class="response svelte-en2lo4">How you approach your work and the world at large can open up new ways of seeing connections and opportunities. This often means being receptive to new routes along the way — many of the steps I have taken to get to this spot have come in an unexpected way, or outside of what my original “plan” was.</p>
                    </div><div class="typography"><p class="response svelte-en2lo4">To best capitalize on these moments of opportunity as they happen, you need to understand and embrace what sets you apart and what unique attributes you offer — not just work skills but life experience outside of the office as well. This can help differentiate you and allow you to jump on those unexpected moments of opportunity without hesitation.</p>
                    </div><div class="typography"><p class="response svelte-en2lo4">One trait that has helped me (and one I believe is salient advice for professionals at any level) is the ability to engage authentically. My perspective has grown and shifted so much, shaped by the genuine connections I have made over the course of my career and have helped get me to where I am today.</p>
                    </div><div class="typography"><p class="response svelte-en2lo4">As we continue to grapple with the impact of COVID-19 on our lives and our nation's long-deferred reckoning with racism keeps testing us to consider what's truly needed for positive change, it is even more important to practice being an authentic and empathetic leader.</p>
                    </div><div class="typography"><p class="response svelte-en2lo4">Understanding what makes you you and what you bring to the table will help ensure you are positioned to take on new, more challenging opportunities and become an influential force not just in your work but also in your community.</p>

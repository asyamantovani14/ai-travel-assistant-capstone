Snow and Santa, right? Well, let me change your mind.  6 Helsinki, Finland’s southern capital, sits on a peninsula in the Gulf of Finland  6 Fiona and her family on Seurasaari Island  I took my family of four to the gorgeous capital of Finland, Helsinki, and couldn't recommend it highly enough as a family-friendly destination.  Forget Santa and festivities and snowball fights, this trip was all about saunas and foraging and outdoor swimming for myself, my husband James and our daughters Lily, 7, and Rosie, 4.  The city might not be the first place you think of for a family break, but it has it all.  From gorgeous nature parks and sea views to daily saunas and delicious fare, you begin to see why the Finns are so happy.  TAKE TO THE SKIES  Everyone knows flying with kids can be a challenge at the best of times but Finnair made it comfortable and stress free.  And it all began with perfectly timed flights. Finnair operates up to ten flights a week from Dublin to Helsinki, year-round, with prices starting from €170 allowing families to choose days and times that best suit their needs.  Our journey began with a 9.45am departure from Dublin which meant we didn't have to contend with a grump-inducing early start. For our return, we opted for an afternoon flight giving us the chance to enjoy the city for one last time before heading home.  The cabin crew were especially kind and attentive to the girls setting the tone for the warm and welcoming treatment we continued to experience upon arrival.  On the return journey I even had the pleasure of flying business class which was a leg-stretching delight with bubbles, a delicious meal and I almost got through a whole book in one go. Unheard of.  Most importantly, Finnair delivered on punctuality with everything running on time. This meant no delays, no extra hassle, just smooth and efficient travel that's exactly what families need.  Flying from Dublin takes around three hours and the airport is about 30 minutes from the city centre. You can get a taxi at the airport for a fixed rate or a train directly there.  We stayed at Hotel Scandic Park Helsinki, where room rates start from €204 per night, in a family room with pull-out couch for the girls.  The hotel was family-friendly with a playroom right by the restaurant, perfect for the kids to jump around in while James and I enjoyed a leisurely dinner or breakfast.  They loved it and made firm friends during the week there. It really should be a must for every hotel.  CULTURE VULTURE  On the first day we met with our guide Karin, who couldn't have been warmer or more informative, and off we trotted to the impressive Helsinki Central Library Oodi, a modern architectural marvel designed by Finnish firm ALA Architects.  More than just a library, Oodi offers visitors a wealth of knowledge, creative resources, and a space to engage with the city’s diverse urban life.  Inside Europe's best airport with fewer liquid restrictions, kid’s attractions and £20 flights from the UK  And for the girls there are several playgrounds around the library which is also close to the picturesque Töölö Lake.  BACK TO NATURE  Another highlight of the trip was a Foraging Walk on Seurasaari Island.  Guided by Anna Nyman - a biologist, forager and herbalist - she unveiled to us a world of wild edible plants and herbs.  We nibbled on heart's-ease pansies, ground elder, wood sorrel, and even the kids munched on some flora. Rosie particularly liked the flowers of the blueberry plant.  The island itself is a tranquil retreat, popular with walkers, sunbathers, and outdoors enthusiasts and there we got to feed some local wildlife too before snacking on a gorgeous picnic provided by Anna in the sunshine. Highly recommended.  THRILLS AND SPILLS  Then, in contrast to the relaxing morning spent being at one with nature, we set off to do something a bit more high-octane.  Linnanmaki Amusement Park is Finland’s oldest and most popular amusement park, located in the Alppila district of Helsinki and it's celebrating its 75th anniversary this year.  The park features over 40 rides, a wide variety of games, and numerous restaurants and cafés.  The girls are still too young, and short, to go on some of the park’s wildest spins and most exciting rides like Swingi - which swings visitors from side to side at nearly 100 kilometres per hour, or the rollercoaster Taiga - that throws you upside down four times per ride with a top speed of 106 km/h.  But we did go on some more of the sedate rides and the girls enjoyed being budding truck drivers on Rekkaralli, and spinning around on Propelli amongst loads of other fun attractions.  I SEE THE SEA  While in Helsinki we also took the ferry across to Suomenlinna, the historic Sea Fortress and UNESCO World Heritage Site, steeped in maritime history and charm.  We met our very informative guide Kasper at the pier and he talked us all around the island, while the girls loved exploring.  The entire area of Suomenlinna has about 200 buildings from different eras spread over 80 hectares of land.  The fortress alone has about 6km of walls and over a hundred cannons remaining.  It is a must when you visit Helsinki. You can enjoy Suomenlinna with just the price of a ferry or water bus ticket, as there is no entrance fee to the fortress.  One of the main routes runs through the fortress from north to south.  The Blue Route starts at the main pier in front of the pink Jetty Barracks and the Visitor Center and ends at the King’s Gate. It's about 1.5km long and marked with blue signs on signposts and a blue line on maps.  Along the route, you'll find information boards in the Russian Merchant Quarter, by the Church Park, in the Great Courtyard, at the Dry Dock viewing platform, in Piper’s Park, and at Kustaanmiekka, the southernmost part of the fortress.  And there are plenty of museums, cafés and restaurants along this route too.  SWEAT IT OUT  Capping off our cultural adventure we immersed ourselves in Finnish wellness traditions with a sauna and swim at Allas Pool, a popular waterfront spa with stunning views - tickets available for €18.  So good we went twice in the five days we spent in Helsinki, Allas Pool is a marine spa and an oasis of urban culture right at the heart of the city.  It's open all year round and offers new ways of enjoying the Baltic Sea, just a stone's throw away from the Market Square and other main attractions.  It has three saunas, two warm water pools and one sea water pool, to which the water is pumped from nearby streams and filtered clean.  One of the pools is perfect for kids, with tummy height water for them and floaties and pool noodles are available from the lifeguards.  In addition to these, an outdoor gym, restaurant and café services, guided wellness and sports lessons and culture events are on offer.  We spent hours there on both visits and had dinner and cocktails in the Seagrill beach house restaurant on the second floor one evening.  The beach house noodles were delicious and chock full of fresh, crunchy veggies and the girls devoured a watermelon, pineapple, grapes and strawberry fresh fruit platter.  Speaking of saunas, they're really a must for visitors to Finland.  Finland actually has more saunas than cars - roughly one sauna for every 1.67 people.  But the real question is - is everyone nude? And the answer is - kinda. It actually depends on where you go.  Check the dress code and remember wearing a towel is always ok.  Just one minute in cold water after the sauna boosts your happy hormones.  When you alternate the heat of the sauna with a 30 - 60 second dip in the sea, lake, or cold shower, your body responds with a rush of feel-good hormones.  And I was so surprised when Lily and Rosie loved the sauna at Allas pool.  The two mini-pros popped in and out several times relaxing in the heat until their cheeks went pink, then they were back in the pool for some more fun until they fancied another session.  SAUNA TIPS FOR NEWBIES Don't sweat it There are no strict rules — but how you feel is a good guide.  All are welcome: kids, elders, locals, visitors.  Check if there is a dress code in the sauna you’re entering – in public mixed saunas you often wear a swimsuit, meanwhile in a swimming pool you usually don't. Wearing a towel is always ok.  Hydration is key. Drink water, and sit on whichever bench level feels right for you.  There are no rules on how long you should be inside the sauna. Head out to cool off when you feel hot.  The felt hat some people wear? It helps regulate body temperature.  Ask a local. Most are happy to share their approach.  DELICIOUS FARE  Right across from the pool is the funky restaurant Toppa. Toppa is on the top floor of the historic and outstanding 'Sugar Cube' building  designed by Alvar Aalto.  Food here is meant to be shared and we feasted on Bo ssam, a fresh and crunchy Korean classic.  The centrepiece of Bo ssam is succulent pork, marinated and slow-roasted to melt-in-the-mouth perfection that you add to a wrap of crisp green lettuce along with some kimchi, spiced tomatoes, pickled carrots and cucumber.  We also munched on Chorizo Pan, Piri Piri Pulpo and the kids enjoyed the corndog consisting of battered sausage with honey mustard and Korean ketchup. The cocktails were also delicious.  WHERE TO STAY & HOW TO GET THERE Come to happy Helsinki Fiona was a guest of Visit Finland (www.visitfinland.com) and Helsinki Partners (www.myhelsinki.fi).

What to do: Visit: Helsinki Central Library Oodi, a modern architectural marvel designed by Finnish firm ALA Architects. Venture into nature with a Foraging Walk on Seurasaari Island. Enjoy the thrills and spills of Linnanmaki Amusement Park. Take the ferry across to Suomenlinna, the historic Sea Fortress and UNESCO World Heritage Site, stepped in maritime history and charm. Sauna and swim at Allas Pool, a popular waterfront spa with stunning views - tickets available for €18.

The city has 34 public beaches, 21 winter swimming locations, 13 ice rinks, 16 indoor swimming pools and outdoor pools, 812 indoor sports facilities, and 92 dog parks.  Phew. It also has an extensive 1,300 km network of cycling paths, meaning there is literally something for everyone.  Children were warmly welcomed wherever we went and Finnish people are very friendly.  In all, the trip was a massive success and a wonderful family adventure.  It was our second visit to Helsinki, where James and I got engaged 10 years ago, and we’ll definitely return – hopefully we won't wait another decade to experience it all.  6 Allas Pool is a marine spa and an oasis of urban culture right at the heart of the city  6 Lily having fun at one of the many playgrounds near Helsinki Central Library Oodi  6 Rosie enjoying 'nature's playground' on Seurasaari Island"

Donegal Bay, Ireland  Surf lessons can be taken at Tullan ALAMY  Scenic surf safari  Pick up a camper van from Knock airport, fill it with wetsuits as well as family and/or friends, and you’ve got the makings of a beginner-friendly surf safari, heading north into Donegal Bay in northwest Ireland.

Several campsites provide hot showers and electric hook-ups (from £39 at Strandhill; sligocaravanandcamping.ie).

Frisian Islands, the Netherlands  The Terschelling coast can be reached by ferry from Amsterdam GETTY IMAGES  Flight-free island-hopping  Restless souls will love the Frisian Islands. Low-slung scraps land on the edge of the North Sea, they’re in a state of constant flux — washed by powerful tides and tousled by sea breezes. This flight-free holiday serves up three of them, starting with rail travel from London to Amsterdam before transferring to Texel, Vlieland and Terschelling by ferry. Expect lonely lighthouses, freewheeling bike tours and artisan ice cream — as well as an enveloping sense of the sea.

The Adler Lodge Ritten, near Bolzano in northern Italy, gives you the South Tyrolean Alps rather than the sea — and every aspect of life here deepens the sense of place: the chic suites and private chalets smell of the local spruce or larch from which they’re built; menus groan with produce from the resort’s organic farm; and the region’s underrated vineyards furnish much of the wine. There’s plenty of scope for relaxation in the forest spa and infinity pool, but don’t get too comfy — “movement is life” is the motto here, with yoga classes, mountain biking and guided hikes all part of the package.  Details: All-inclusive suites from £666 (adler-resorts.com). Fly to Bolzano  4. Terceira, Azores, Portugal  The Santa Maria Manuela is great ship for sailing beginners  Learn the ropes on a tall ship  Here’s a sure way to escape summer-holiday clichés: step aboard the Santa Maria Manuela. The four-masted, 221ft schooner began life fishing for cod and is now an elegant, beginner-friendly sail-training ship. This August it’s sailing the Azores, a nine-island archipelago 1,000 miles west of mainland Portugal, and up to 44 guests aged between 14 and 80 can join the professional crew — learning the ropes, climbing the rigging and keeping a lookout for whales and dolphins. This six-day round-trip from Terceira includes the volcanic island of Pico, as well as the rugged Sao Jorge.  Details Five nights’ full board from £1,105pp (venturesailholidays.com). Fly to Lajes  5.

Every day will be magnificent as you follow a mix of easy, traffic-free cycle paths and quiet country roads to some of the country’s most eye-catching châteaux — Château de Villandry, with its neatly clipped parterres, is also on your hit list. So too are four fine dining gastronomic dinners (included in the price) that are sure to soothe the parents’ aching muscles.  Details Seven nights’ B&B from £1,440pp (cyclingforsofties.com).

Bergen, Vestland, Norway  White-water rafting is among the activities on offer in the fjords HÅVARD NESBO  Fly-drive into the fjords  “I’m bored” is a phrase you won’t often hear from your kids on this one-week, self-guided tour of the fjords near Bergen, on the west coast of Norway — especially not on the fourth day, when you ride the spectacular Flam Railway from Sognefjord up to Myrdal before mountain biking back down to the water. En route you’ll stay in hotels with three or four stars, as well as a national park cabin, with white-water rafting, a Rib tour in search of seals and a glacier walk all on the menu.

Dakhla, Dakhla-Oued Ed-Dahab, Western Sahara  Kite-surfing by the Sahara  Summer holidays on the edge of the Sahara desert sound insane, unless you’re a kite-surfer keening for strong, steady and reliable winds, in which case a trip to the Dakhla Lagoon — where it’s windy 300 days a year — is a must. Here the low-slung Caravan Dakhla by Our Habitas hotel is the big draw, thanks to its Maghreb-influenced decor of lime-plastered walls and intricately carved doors, as well as its outdoor cinema and all-inclusive meal plan. Book a New Adventures package of more than three nights and beginners will get a free kite-surfing lesson too.

Paddling the coastline of the Peljesac peninsula and Korcula Island on this group tour, you’ll carry your tents with you and discover a landscape of secret coves and empty beaches.

Dipping in and out of underrated cities, they weave along the verdant northern coast and offer plenty of seaside stops en route. This one-week itinerary makes its way from the fishing village of Cudillero to beachfront Ribadesella via cultured Oviedo, serving up a giddy sense of history, from the prehistoric cave paintings at Tito Bustillo to the 19th-century trophy homes built by emigrés returning from the Americas — you’ll stay in two of them during your trip.

Tirana and the south, Albania  The island castle of Ali Pasha was rebuilt in 1819 ALAMY  Coast, cities and mountains  The Albanian coast may be in the spotlight, but inland its majestic landscapes remain underpopulated and undervisited, while archaeological sites layer up thousands of years of history in an intriguing mix of Roman, Byzantine, Venetian and Ottoman remains. This seven-day escorted tour from Tirana takes in the extraordinary island castle of Ali Pasha, lunch in a remote shepherd’s hut in the mountains and the bucolic riverside city of Berat, capped by a Byzantine citadel and where every backstreet seems strewn with honeysuckle.

Chamois, Aosta Valley, Italy  Chamois is the only village in Italy that cannot be reached by car ALAMY  Alpine village reached by cable car  In 1965 the inhabitants of Chamois, in the Italian Alps, voted on how to replace the mule track that was their only link to the outside world. They decided on a mountain lift rather than a road, and now their village is the only one in Italy that cannot be reached by car. Several of its wonky barns have been converted into B&Bs too, including La Ville, which has a snug, four-person family room with a kitchenette. A family with tweenagers will love it, not least because up here — with no traffic to worry about — the old, freewheeling freedoms of childhood beckon.  Details B&B family rooms from £191 (laville-chamois.it). Fly to Turin  12. Foca, Izmir, Turkey  Volleyball is one of the activities on offer at the Phokaia Beach Resort IVAN SKUFINSKY  Nonstop seaside activity  For sporty families who love the sea, it’s hard to beat a week at a beach club run by Neilson or Mark Warner where a combination of kids’ clubs, sailing facilities, tennis courts, guided runs, fitness classes and bike rides offer nonstop activity from dawn to dusk. Just be sure to aim for the back end of August, so you can dodge the worst of the heatwaves in the Mediterranean, where they’re all based. The Phokaia Beach Resort in Turkey is typical of the genre, with the attraction of sunset beach volleyball sessions to add to the social buzz.  Details Seven nights’ half-board from £1,385pp, including flights (markwarner.co.uk)  13. The Arctic Coast Way, Nordurland, Iceland  The awe-inspiring waterfall at Dettifoss GETTY IMAGES  A big drive with no traffic  Iceland may be fretting about overtourism, but you won’t know it when you hire a camper van from Keflavik airport, head northwards and sample a stretch of the 560-mile Arctic Coast Way. Up here neat, well-run campsites are almost never full and cost about £13pp a night (tjoldumiskagafirdi.is), while scenic outdoor hot tubs and thermal pools are on hand in every significant settlement to supplement the faint warmth of sun. The real thrill, however, comes from the landscape — not the big set pieces such as the mountainous Skagafjordur peninsula or the thunderous waterfall at Dettifoss, although they are undeniably impressive; it’s the emptiness in between them that you’ll remember.  Details Seven nights’ self-catering for four from £1,198 (indiecampers.com). Fly to Keflavik  • 22 of the best things to do in Iceland  Advertisement  14. Gothenburg, Vastra Gotaland, Sweden  The colourful architecture of Vastra Gotaland ALAMY  The west coast by train  The clear seas and rocky shores of the islands in Vastra Gotaland are your goal on this tailor-made ten-day tour. But you’re not going to hurry getting there — en route by train, you’ll explore Hamburg, Copenhagen and Gothenburg, before the island-hopping begins. Sea-kayaking, mussel-picking and a foraging tour all feature, as does a near-constant sense of exploration. From seeing the vibrant nightlife of the German city to the pretty harbour town of Marstrand and on to the rocky islets around Tjorn in Sweden, every day is going to be different. Hotels range from friendly guesthouses to stylish four stars, depending on your budget.  Details Nine nights’ room only from £2,095pp, including train travel from London (originaltravel.co.uk)  15.

This family-friendly fly-drive into the Finnish Lake District does it by tackling the biggest of them all: Saimaa, which is hundreds of times larger than the Windermere. There is room here for all kinds of holidaymaking — touring medieval fortresses, cruising on steamers, paddleboarding, rowing, swimming. As you flit between three different lakeside resorts and manor houses you’ll get the chance to try all these activities, but the most important one is simply to stop and let the sense of serenity soak in.

https://www.nomadicmatt.com/travel-blogs/traveling-family-interview/,How this Family Took Their Kids on a Trip Around the World,Matthew Kepnes,2009-04-30 17:25:58+00:00,"As a follow-up to last week’s guest post on traveling with kids, this week I interviewed the James, the family behind The Wide Wide World about what it is like traveling as a family together and how that affects the family relationship.  I got a chance to meet them in January when they were in Bangkok. I had been following their blog for a while and was excited at the chance – the dynamics of family travel intrigue me. They are a wonderful and friendly family. Craig and Dani, the parents, are warm, friendly, and very intelligent and have imparted that onto their children, Connor and Caroline. With that introduction, here are the questions I put to them:  Nomadic Matt: Did you have reservations about traveling as a family?  [Craig] We did. We knew that this trip would mean we’d go for long stretches seeing only each other, 24/7. That can challenge any relationship. But we also saw the opportunity – the chance to spend quality time with our children before they left us. I think we all agree that we’ve gotten along better than we could have hoped.  [Dani] I agree – I think we have grown closer as a result of this trip. Over long lunches and dinners, day after day, night after night, things just spill out of your kids. We’ve learned so much about their lives as a result of our time together. And I think we all see each other more clearly for the people we are. Extended travel as a family can be challenging at times, but for us, it has really been worth it.  How did you come up with the idea and plan this trip?  [Craig] This trip grew out of an on-going conversation that Dani and I had been having. We knew that in June 2008 both of our kids would be changing schools. Caroline was going to be entering high school; Conor (age 11) would be heading off to middle school. We knew that if we were ever going to do something out of the ordinary, this was the year to do it.  The first idea I suggested was to live a year in Australia. I have friends there, and I found that we could enroll our kids in Australian public school for a modest amount of money. Dani didn’t say no, but she wasn’t excited about the idea. She thought living in Australia would be too similar to living in the U.S. So we tried to expand our thinking.  One day, we found a Canadian family, the Carlsons, who took a round the world trip in 2001. We read their web site, then emailed them. Five years after the Carlsons returned home, they were all doing well and considered their trip around the world to be a life-changing experience.  One day Dani came running in my office (I work at home) and told me to turn on Oprah. Dani rarely watches daytime TV, but happened to have it on that day. When I tuned in I saw why Dani was so excited. Oprah was doing a satellite interview with the Andrus Family of Atlanta, Georgia, from the top of Table Mountain in Capetown, South Africa.  I immediately went to their blog and read every word. I think that’s the moment I knew our family could do a round-the-world trip too.  We spent a lot of time talking about where we would go, what we would do, what life on the road would be like. We had a very open discussion about our expectations and our concerns. The more we talked about it, the more we wanted to do it, and the more we believed we could do it. We knew it would a challenge, that there would be good days and not-so-good days.  Still, we all knew it was the chance of a lifetime.  What did your friends and family think?  [Dani] Telling our families was, without a doubt, the most difficult part. For our parents, the idea was so far from their realm of experience. They had no way to comprehend what we were doing. Still, once they got over the initial shock, our families have been supportive.  One of the things that has surprised us most — something we never predicted and didn’t expect — is the wide range of reactions from our friends and family.  We have casual friends who have adopted our trip as their “cause,” sending us information about every stop on our itinerary. And we have good friends who do everything they can to avoid even acknowledging that we are going to be away for a year.  One family in our neighborhood studiously avoided mentioning our trip to either Craig or me. But they pumped our kids for information at every turn. But frankly, for most people, it’s out of sight, out of mind. We won’t exist till we are back home.  [Craig] It reminds me of something John W. Gardner once said: “At a certain point in your life you learn that people are neither for you or against you — they’re thinking about themselves.”  On the other hand, we’ve also been surprised by the number of people who have reached out to us, offering encouragement and advice. Several other travelers [including Nomadic Matt, we are proud to say] have found us on the web and been very helpful.  There really does seem to be a different spirit among travelers. It’s refreshing to talk to people who share information rather than hoard it.  What has life on the road been like?  [Craig] Life on the road has been like life at home, only different. Traveling for a year seems so exotic, and it is at times. But you still have to find a place to sleep, food to eat, and something to do each day. The difference, though is the excitement of constant change, amazing places and the opportunity to meet interesting people.  [Dani] It’s an odd experience to see a great site like Machu Picchu in the morning and then homeschool your kids in the afternoon. There are challenges in moving your life to a new town or a new country every few days. But the opportunity to see the world makes the challenges pale in comparison.  What unexpected things has traveling as a family brought you on the road?  [Dani] Every day brings something unexpected. A sight. A sound. A new person or experience. We have come to expect the unexpected. The best surprise, though, has been the opportunity to gain a real appreciation for the people our children are becoming. It’s been wonderful to watch.  I think some of the best surprises — and most unexpected lessons — have come from the people we’ve met. We’ve been fortunate to meet some great people — other travelers and locals. Another important lesson has been the way we’ve been welcomed everywhere we’ve traveled. People have treated us very well, and I think our children have learned not to be afraid of the world, other people and other cultures.  Do you have any advice for other people thinking about traveling with kids?  [Craig] If a person or family really wants to take time off to travel the world, they can figure our a way to do it. It may take some creativity. It may take some compromise. But it can be done. But the first step is really wanting to do it.  In my search for other families traveling the world, I discovered a Kiwi family of ten (ten!) who are currently traveling through Asia as part of a multi-year travel adventure. They saved for this trip, pinching pennies, for years. But family travel was their dream — and they worked together to achieve it. You have to respect and admire that.  Every day I am acutely aware of how fragile it all is. As we have traveled this year, there are two thoughts I keep coming back to.  First, I have a new appreciation for what’s possible, for what a family can do together. I have nothing but admiration and respect for the many families who are out there living their lives on their own terms. That’s what I aspire to.  Second, I am deeply grateful for my wife and my children, for their spirit of adventure, for their willingness to take a leap of faith into the world. I hope they never lose their sense of wonder, their willingness to break from the pack, and their ability to confront their fears, take a risk and move forward.  This trip is the best thing we’ve ever done. I can’t wait to see what happens next.  And of course, I wanted to know what the kids, Conor(11) and Caroline(14), thought:  Were you excited to travel for so long? Were you excited to travel with your family?  [Caroline] I had mixed emotions about traveling for so long. I was excited by the idea, but I was also afraid. Plus, I didn’t want to miss my friends and my first year of high school. And I was worried about being with my family 24/7. But I’ve been able to stay touch with friends through Skype, Google video chats and Facebook. And we have all gotten along and grown closer.  [Conor] I was excited to travel and see the world. I knew it was a special opportunity to do something not many other people get to do. I have missed my friends, but it has been worth it. The hardest time has been around holidays like Christmas. That’s when I miss normal life.  What is the coolest thing you have done? What has been the worst?  [Caroline] We’ve done a lot of cool things. I really liked zip-lining in Ecuador, swimming with sea lions in the Galapagos, and taking care of elephants in Thailand. I really liked traveling in New Zealand, Australia, and Japan. The worst thing we did was to ride a really dirty bus across northern Argentina. It was nasty.  [Conor] The Galapagos were great. I liked living on a boat and traveling from island to island. I also liked all the adventure sports in New Zealand, especially zorbing. And it was really cool to ride a mile long luge from the top of The Great Wall. There haven’t been too many bad things. I suppose the worst thing has been all the time we’ve spent waiting in airports or at train or bus stations.  Are you glad you did this? Do you want to travel in the future or has this experience made you hate traveling?  [Caroline] Now that we are almost done I’m really glad we did this. I feel like I’ve done something that very few people will ever do. I do think I will travel in the future, but probably not for this long. One day, I would like to return to Thailand to work with the elephants at the Elephant Nature Park near Chiang Mai.  [Conor] I am really glad we did this too. I’ll be glad to get home, but we have been able to see and do so much. In the future, though, I don’t think I’ll travel for this long. I think I’ll take more trips, but for shorter periods of time. There is so much to see in the world, you can spend your whole life exploring.  ***  Go read their blog and follow them around the world at The Wide Wide World."

https://www.cntraveler.com/story/why-barcelona-is-one-of-europes-most-family-friendly-cities,4 Parents Share Their Tips for Enjoying Barcelona as a Family,Hannah Towey,2025-01-15 21:27:08.476000+00:00,"Spain consistently ranks as one of our readers' favorite countries to visit, with evergreen holiday destinations like Mallorca and thriving cultural capitals like Madrid and Barcelona. While the latter may be widely beloved for its youthful nightlife and ancient history, it's also an underrated city for families traveling with kids and teenagers.  We talked to four parents who live in the US, UK, Spain, and Portugal about what makes Barcelona a go-to favorite for families with children of all ages—including Gaudí's quirky imprint on the city, its highly walkable neighborhoods, stroller-friendly public transportation, and more.  A flight attendant’s first family trip with 10-month-old twins  Shanice Reis  “I'm a part-time flight attendant and I'm a first-time mum to 18-month twin girls. I’ve been a flight attendant for 8.5 years and my mum used to be one too, so I want my daughters to share our travel bug. I want them to understand what I do and also to know that there's other things out there—different cultures and foods and lifestyles. For our first family trip all together, we went to Barcelona. Sevenah and Venesah were just 10 months old. My husband and I had previously been to Barcelona and we both loved it—and knew the weather would be lovely that time of year as well. We didn't really have a set itinerary, it was more of a go-with-the-flow situation. It was less about seeing the popular attractions and more about getting the twins used to walking around in different environments, getting them used to eating out and dining in restaurants, that kind of thing. It was our first family holiday, so we tried to take as many pictures as we could, and we took them to the beach. We visited La Sagrada Familia and I think they were in awe of it, because it was so big and tall—it was nice to see their excited faces. I found the public transportation in Barcelona to be very family-friendly. On the metro, every stop had an elevator that we could get onto with a double stroller. And every restaurant we went to had two high chairs available, which isn’t always the case elsewhere. The locals were always happy to help us with the kids. If they saw us with the stroller, they'd let you go ahead first, or help pick it up. Even in restaurants, the waiters and waitresses always interacted with them. The twins tried patatas bravas for the first time! We also went to a fine dining restaurant called Xavier Pellicer. I was a bit dubious at bringing the girls there, because I thought they might be loud, but they were great and it was so nice to have that little adult time, even with the kids. My advice for other parents is: Don't be afraid to do something for yourself. I know it is a family trip, but go to that fine dining restaurant that you want to visit, or that hotel that you've always wanted to stay at.” —Shanice Reis  A genealogist's family reunion  “My family is from the Basque region of Spain on my mother’s side and from the Navarre and Aragon regions on my father’s side. For me, family has always meant everything. When everything goes to the crapper, there's always family. So from that point of view, it's always been important for me to be able to tell my daughter about who they are. I actually run a genealogy research firm—and every person involved in ancestry research has a story to tell. One of our first trips to Spain together as a family was to Barcelona, which we loved because there was an amazing dichotomy between what adults can do and what children have access to. For this trip, we started out in Paris and took a taxi cab to Disneyland. We spent the whole day there and then we boarded an overnight train from Paris to Barcelona, where my uncles and cousins from Zaragoza later met us. We had the entire sleeper car to ourselves and my daughter, who was 12 years old at the time, absolutely loved jumping from bunk bed to bunk bed. We got up early in the morning to watch the countryside pass by the window. It was just an excellent way for us to spend time together as a family and see part of the country that we would never have gotten to see. What’s great is that Barcelona is a modern city—we normally stay in Hilton or Marriott hotels—but you can still really experience its ancient history and culture. My daughter loved traipsing through the Roman ruins, and there are still parts of the old aqueducts and Roman baths. Then there’s the influence that Antoni Gaudí had on the city. La Sagrada Familia, obviously, is an unbelievable site to see. We've watched it grow, if you will, over the last 10 to 15 years that we've been visiting the city into what it is today. It's a slow construction process, but it's magnificent, and you can still go inside and see the light coming through the stained glass windows, which my daughter loved. Kids have a blast at Park Güell too. It’s so quirky and there are hardly any straight lines. My daughter would sit down in the park and she would take a piece of paper out and try to sketch some of the things she saw. We probably have some of those still in a box somewhere.” —Mark Minguillon  How to Travel With Kids, According to Globetrotting Parents Toddlers, teens, and everything in between.  A Barcelona family explores their home turf  Jordi Aguilar  “We are actually from Spain, but because of my job, we moved to the US for six years, first to Orlando and then to New York. We moved back to Barcelona a little over a year ago. We always loved to travel before we had our daughter Chloe but now with her, it feels even more adventurous. It’s exciting knowing all the benefits that travel has had on her development. She's only two years old and she has already traveled to four continents and lived in three different cities in two countries. Because of that, she's independent and has developed a sense of curiosity and respect for other cultures. Right now, if you ask her what their favorite meal is, she would say ramen, which she tried in Japan. And that's weird for a kid, you know. We always recommend travelers to visit Barcelona because any time of the year is a good moment to travel here—like all Mediterranean countries, Spain has a mild climate so it doesn’t normally get too hot during the summer or too cold during the winter. Unlike Orlando or New York! Also, it’s a very walkable city, which is really important when you have kids in strollers. We recommend families stay in the Grácia neighborhood north of Barcelona, it’s a little village with plenty of cute car-free streets and cafés—it’s a great vibe. And if you want to be closer to the city center, then stay in Eixample. Chloe loves to explore, so all these little neighborhoods are great for her to wander around freely. There are also so many great places within 30 minutes of the city for day trips. There’s Montserra, a beautiful mountain that I love, and Costa Brava north of Barcelona has amazing blue water and incredible beaches.” —Jordi Aguilar  A globetrotter's pre-cruise visit with five kids  “We left for full-time travel when our youngest daughter was a year old. After traveling throughout the US and Hawaii, we continued on to Asia for seven months, then Europe for another six months, and then lived in New Zealand. Now we live in Portugal. Our youngest is seven and our oldest is 17, both girls. Our three boys in the middle are 9, 11, and 14 years old. We went to Barcelona this fall in anticipation of a cruise and spent two full days in the city. Barcelona is well set up as a cruise port, so it was not difficult at all to access the cruises from the city center. Spain is huge on kids. You're always seeing kids at dinner with all the adults. There's no separation of ‘the kid’s table’—that just doesn't exist. I never feel like young kids are unwelcome in Spain, unlike some other European countries. Whenever we travel, it is always a bit of a balance finding things all seven of us enjoy regardless of age. In Barcelona, we visited Casa Batlló, the coolest of the three Gaudí houses. The kids surprisingly all loved it—they’re not typically into architecture but the audio guide was really entertaining. Because we are often taking the kids out of school to travel, we’ll treat historic or cultural activities like this as a substitute. Sometimes I’ll tell them they can do homework pages or, for example, participate in the audio guide of this historical monument. They'll usually opt for that because it's just much more fun!” —Leslie Stroud"

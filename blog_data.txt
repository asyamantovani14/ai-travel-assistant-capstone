As a follow-up to last week’s guest post on traveling with kids, this week I interviewed the James, the family behind The Wide Wide World about what it is like traveling as a family together and how that affects the family relationship.

I got a chance to meet them in January when they were in Bangkok. I had been following their blog for a while and was excited at the chance – the dynamics of family travel intrigue me. They are a wonderful and friendly family. Craig and Dani, the parents, are warm, friendly, and very intelligent and have imparted that onto their children, Connor and Caroline. With that introduction, here are the questions I put to them:

Nomadic Matt: Did you have reservations about traveling as a family?

[Craig] We did. We knew that this trip would mean we’d go for long stretches seeing only each other, 24/7. That can challenge any relationship. But we also saw the opportunity – the chance to spend quality time with our children before they left us. I think we all agree that we’ve gotten along better than we could have hoped.

[Dani] I agree – I think we have grown closer as a result of this trip. Over long lunches and dinners, day after day, night after night, things just spill out of your kids. We’ve learned so much about their lives as a result of our time together. And I think we all see each other more clearly for the people we are. Extended travel as a family can be challenging at times, but for us, it has really been worth it.

How did you come up with the idea and plan this trip?

[Craig] This trip grew out of an on-going conversation that Dani and I had been having. We knew that in June 2008 both of our kids would be changing schools. Caroline was going to be entering high school; Conor (age 11) would be heading off to middle school. We knew that if we were ever going to do something out of the ordinary, this was the year to do it.

The first idea I suggested was to live a year in Australia. I have friends there, and I found that we could enroll our kids in Australian public school for a modest amount of money. Dani didn’t say no, but she wasn’t excited about the idea. She thought living in Australia would be too similar to living in the U.S. So we tried to expand our thinking.

One day, we found a Canadian family, the Carlsons, who took a round the world trip in 2001. We read their web site, then emailed them. Five years after the Carlsons returned home, they were all doing well and considered their trip around the world to be a life-changing experience.

One day Dani came running in my office (I work at home) and told me to turn on Oprah. Dani rarely watches daytime TV, but happened to have it on that day. When I tuned in I saw why Dani was so excited. Oprah was doing a satellite interview with the Andrus Family of Atlanta, Georgia, from the top of Table Mountain in Capetown, South Africa.

I immediately went to their blog and read every word. I think that’s the moment I knew our family could do a round-the-world trip too.

We spent a lot of time talking about where we would go, what we would do, what life on the road would be like. We had a very open discussion about our expectations and our concerns. The more we talked about it, the more we wanted to do it, and the more we believed we could do it. We knew it would a challenge, that there would be good days and not-so-good days.

Still, we all knew it was the chance of a lifetime.

What did your friends and family think?

[Dani] Telling our families was, without a doubt, the most difficult part. For our parents, the idea was so far from their realm of experience. They had no way to comprehend what we were doing. Still, once they got over the initial shock, our families have been supportive.

One of the things that has surprised us most — something we never predicted and didn’t expect — is the wide range of reactions from our friends and family.

We have casual friends who have adopted our trip as their “cause,” sending us information about every stop on our itinerary. And we have good friends who do everything they can to avoid even acknowledging that we are going to be away for a year.

One family in our neighborhood studiously avoided mentioning our trip to either Craig or me. But they pumped our kids for information at every turn. But frankly, for most people, it’s out of sight, out of mind. We won’t exist till we are back home.

[Craig] It reminds me of something John W. Gardner once said: “At a certain point in your life you learn that people are neither for you or against you — they’re thinking about themselves.”

On the other hand, we’ve also been surprised by the number of people who have reached out to us, offering encouragement and advice. Several other travelers [including Nomadic Matt, we are proud to say] have found us on the web and been very helpful.

There really does seem to be a different spirit among travelers. It’s refreshing to talk to people who share information rather than hoard it.

What has life on the road been like?

[Craig] Life on the road has been like life at home, only different. Traveling for a year seems so exotic, and it is at times. But you still have to find a place to sleep, food to eat, and something to do each day. The difference, though is the excitement of constant change, amazing places and the opportunity to meet interesting people.

[Dani] It’s an odd experience to see a great site like Machu Picchu in the morning and then homeschool your kids in the afternoon. There are challenges in moving your life to a new town or a new country every few days. But the opportunity to see the world makes the challenges pale in comparison.

What unexpected things has traveling as a family brought you on the road?

[Dani] Every day brings something unexpected. A sight. A sound. A new person or experience. We have come to expect the unexpected. The best surprise, though, has been the opportunity to gain a real appreciation for the people our children are becoming. It’s been wonderful to watch.

I think some of the best surprises — and most unexpected lessons — have come from the people we’ve met. We’ve been fortunate to meet some great people — other travelers and locals. Another important lesson has been the way we’ve been welcomed everywhere we’ve traveled. People have treated us very well, and I think our children have learned not to be afraid of the world, other people and other cultures.

Do you have any advice for other people thinking about traveling with kids?

[Craig] If a person or family really wants to take time off to travel the world, they can figure our a way to do it. It may take some creativity. It may take some compromise. But it can be done. But the first step is really wanting to do it.

In my search for other families traveling the world, I discovered a Kiwi family of ten (ten!) who are currently traveling through Asia as part of a multi-year travel adventure. They saved for this trip, pinching pennies, for years. But family travel was their dream — and they worked together to achieve it. You have to respect and admire that.

Every day I am acutely aware of how fragile it all is. As we have traveled this year, there are two thoughts I keep coming back to.

First, I have a new appreciation for what’s possible, for what a family can do together. I have nothing but admiration and respect for the many families who are out there living their lives on their own terms. That’s what I aspire to.

Second, I am deeply grateful for my wife and my children, for their spirit of adventure, for their willingness to take a leap of faith into the world. I hope they never lose their sense of wonder, their willingness to break from the pack, and their ability to confront their fears, take a risk and move forward.

This trip is the best thing we’ve ever done. I can’t wait to see what happens next.

And of course, I wanted to know what the kids, Conor(11) and Caroline(14), thought:

Were you excited to travel for so long? Were you excited to travel with your family?

[Caroline] I had mixed emotions about traveling for so long. I was excited by the idea, but I was also afraid. Plus, I didn’t want to miss my friends and my first year of high school. And I was worried about being with my family 24/7. But I’ve been able to stay touch with friends through Skype, Google video chats and Facebook. And we have all gotten along and grown closer.

[Conor] I was excited to travel and see the world. I knew it was a special opportunity to do something not many other people get to do. I have missed my friends, but it has been worth it. The hardest time has been around holidays like Christmas. That’s when I miss normal life.

What is the coolest thing you have done? What has been the worst?

[Caroline] We’ve done a lot of cool things. I really liked zip-lining in Ecuador, swimming with sea lions in the Galapagos, and taking care of elephants in Thailand. I really liked traveling in New Zealand, Australia, and Japan. The worst thing we did was to ride a really dirty bus across northern Argentina. It was nasty.

[Conor] The Galapagos were great. I liked living on a boat and traveling from island to island. I also liked all the adventure sports in New Zealand, especially zorbing. And it was really cool to ride a mile long luge from the top of The Great Wall. There haven’t been too many bad things. I suppose the worst thing has been all the time we’ve spent waiting in airports or at train or bus stations.

Are you glad you did this? Do you want to travel in the future or has this experience made you hate traveling?

[Caroline] Now that we are almost done I’m really glad we did this. I feel like I’ve done something that very few people will ever do. I do think I will travel in the future, but probably not for this long. One day, I would like to return to Thailand to work with the elephants at the Elephant Nature Park near Chiang Mai.

[Conor] I am really glad we did this too. I’ll be glad to get home, but we have been able to see and do so much. In the future, though, I don’t think I’ll travel for this long. I think I’ll take more trips, but for shorter periods of time. There is so much to see in the world, you can spend your whole life exploring.

Spain consistently ranks as one of our readers' favorite countries to visit, with evergreen holiday destinations like Mallorca and thriving cultural capitals like Madrid and Barcelona. While the latter may be widely beloved for its youthful nightlife and ancient history, it's also an underrated city for families traveling with kids and teenagers.

We talked to four parents who live in the US, UK, Spain, and Portugal about what makes Barcelona a go-to favorite for families with children of all ages—including Gaudí's quirky imprint on the city, its highly walkable neighborhoods, stroller-friendly public transportation, and more.

A flight attendant’s first family trip with 10-month-old twins

Shanice Reis

“I'm a part-time flight attendant and I'm a first-time mum to 18-month twin girls. I’ve been a flight attendant for 8.5 years and my mum used to be one too, so I want my daughters to share our travel bug. I want them to understand what I do and also to know that there's other things out there—different cultures and foods and lifestyles. For our first family trip all together, we went to Barcelona. Sevenah and Venesah were just 10 months old. My husband and I had previously been to Barcelona and we both loved it—and knew the weather would be lovely that time of year as well. We didn't really have a set itinerary, it was more of a go-with-the-flow situation. It was less about seeing the popular attractions and more about getting the twins used to walking around in different environments, getting them used to eating out and dining in restaurants, that kind of thing. It was our first family holiday, so we tried to take as many pictures as we could, and we took them to the beach. We visited La Sagrada Familia and I think they were in awe of it, because it was so big and tall—it was nice to see their excited faces. I found the public transportation in Barcelona to be very family-friendly. On the metro, every stop had an elevator that we could get onto with a double stroller. And every restaurant we went to had two high chairs available, which isn’t always the case elsewhere. The locals were always happy to help us with the kids. If they saw us with the stroller, they'd let you go ahead first, or help pick it up. Even in restaurants, the waiters and waitresses always interacted with them. The twins tried patatas bravas for the first time! We also went to a fine dining restaurant called Xavier Pellicer. I was a bit dubious at bringing the girls there, because I thought they might be loud, but they were great and it was so nice to have that little adult time, even with the kids. My advice for other parents is: Don't be afraid to do something for yourself. I know it is a family trip, but go to that fine dining restaurant that you want to visit, or that hotel that you've always wanted to stay at.” —Shanice Reis

A genealogist's family reunion

“My family is from the Basque region of Spain on my mother’s side and from the Navarre and Aragon regions on my father’s side. For me, family has always meant everything. When everything goes to the crapper, there's always family. So from that point of view, it's always been important for me to be able to tell my daughter about who they are. I actually run a genealogy research firm—and every person involved in ancestry research has a story to tell. One of our first trips to Spain together as a family was to Barcelona, which we loved because there was an amazing dichotomy between what adults can do and what children have access to. For this trip, we started out in Paris and took a taxi cab to Disneyland. We spent the whole day there and then we boarded an overnight train from Paris to Barcelona, where my uncles and cousins from Zaragoza later met us. We had the entire sleeper car to ourselves and my daughter, who was 12 years old at the time, absolutely loved jumping from bunk bed to bunk bed. We got up early in the morning to watch the countryside pass by the window. It was just an excellent way for us to spend time together as a family and see part of the country that we would never have gotten to see. What’s great is that Barcelona is a modern city—we normally stay in Hilton or Marriott hotels—but you can still really experience its ancient history and culture. My daughter loved traipsing through the Roman ruins, and there are still parts of the old aqueducts and Roman baths. Then there’s the influence that Antoni Gaudí had on the city. La Sagrada Familia, obviously, is an unbelievable site to see. We've watched it grow, if you will, over the last 10 to 15 years that we've been visiting the city into what it is today. It's a slow construction process, but it's magnificent, and you can still go inside and see the light coming through the stained glass windows, which my daughter loved. Kids have a blast at Park Güell too. It’s so quirky and there are hardly any straight lines. My daughter would sit down in the park and she would take a piece of paper out and try to sketch some of the things she saw. We probably have some of those still in a box somewhere.” —Mark Minguillon

How to Travel With Kids, According to Globetrotting Parents Toddlers, teens, and everything in between.

A Barcelona family explores their home turf

Jordi Aguilar

“We are actually from Spain, but because of my job, we moved to the US for six years, first to Orlando and then to New York. We moved back to Barcelona a little over a year ago. We always loved to travel before we had our daughter Chloe but now with her, it feels even more adventurous. It’s exciting knowing all the benefits that travel has had on her development. She's only two years old and she has already traveled to four continents and lived in three different cities in two countries. Because of that, she's independent and has developed a sense of curiosity and respect for other cultures. Right now, if you ask her what their favorite meal is, she would say ramen, which she tried in Japan. And that's weird for a kid, you know. We always recommend travelers to visit Barcelona because any time of the year is a good moment to travel here—like all Mediterranean countries, Spain has a mild climate so it doesn’t normally get too hot during the summer or too cold during the winter. Unlike Orlando or New York! Also, it’s a very walkable city, which is really important when you have kids in strollers. We recommend families stay in the Grácia neighborhood north of Barcelona, it’s a little village with plenty of cute car-free streets and cafés—it’s a great vibe. And if you want to be closer to the city center, then stay in Eixample. Chloe loves to explore, so all these little neighborhoods are great for her to wander around freely. There are also so many great places within 30 minutes of the city for day trips. There’s Montserra, a beautiful mountain that I love, and Costa Brava north of Barcelona has amazing blue water and incredible beaches.” —Jordi Aguilar

A globetrotter's pre-cruise visit with five kids

“We left for full-time travel when our youngest daughter was a year old. After traveling throughout the US and Hawaii, we continued on to Asia for seven months, then Europe for another six months, and then lived in New Zealand. Now we live in Portugal. Our youngest is seven and our oldest is 17, both girls. Our three boys in the middle are 9, 11, and 14 years old. We went to Barcelona this fall in anticipation of a cruise and spent two full days in the city. Barcelona is well set up as a cruise port, so it was not difficult at all to access the cruises from the city center. Spain is huge on kids. You're always seeing kids at dinner with all the adults. There's no separation of ‘the kid’s table’—that just doesn't exist. I never feel like young kids are unwelcome in Spain, unlike some other European countries. Whenever we travel, it is always a bit of a balance finding things all seven of us enjoy regardless of age. In Barcelona, we visited Casa Batlló, the coolest of the three Gaudí houses. The kids surprisingly all loved it—they’re not typically into architecture but the audio guide was really entertaining. Because we are often taking the kids out of school to travel, we’ll treat historic or cultural activities like this as a substitute. Sometimes I’ll tell them they can do homework pages or, for example, participate in the audio guide of this historical monument. They'll usually opt for that because it's just much more fun!” —Leslie Stroud

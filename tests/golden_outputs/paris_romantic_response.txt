For a romantic weekend in Paris, I recommend staying at Paris Grand Hotel, which is pet-friendly. Start your weekend by visiting the Eiffel Tower and taking a Seine river cruise for breathtaking views of the city. Enjoy a romantic dinner at one of the charming caf√©s in Paris and take a leisurely stroll along the Seine riverbanks. Don't forget to visit iconic landmarks like the Louvre Museum and Notre Dame Cathedral for a truly magical experience in the City of Love.

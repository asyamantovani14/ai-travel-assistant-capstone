For your 5-day road trip in Japan, I recommend starting in Tokyo and exploring the city for a day or two. Visit iconic landmarks like the Tokyo Tower, Senso-ji Temple, and the bustling Shibuya Crossing. 

Next, head to Hakone to relax in onsens (hot springs) and enjoy views of Mount Fuji. You can also visit the Hakone Open-Air Museum and take a cruise on Lake Ashi.

Continue your road trip to Kyoto, where you can explore traditional temples, such as Kinkaku-ji (Golden Pavilion) and Fushimi Inari Taisha Shrine. Don't miss the historic Gion district for a chance to spot geishas.

Lastly, drive to Hiroshima to visit the Peace Memorial Park and Museum to learn about the city's history. You can also take a ferry to Miyajima Island to see the famous floating torii gate.

Make sure to book accommodations in advance at pet-friendly options like Japan Inn, Japan Grand Hotel, or Japan Stay & Go to ensure a comfortable stay for you and your furry companion. Enjoy your road trip in Japan!

That sounds like a great adventure! While I don't have a specific itinerary, I can suggest a route. Start your journey in Tokyo, where you can explore the city's vibrant culture and food scene. Then, drive towards Mount Fuji, enjoying the scenic views along the way. Spend a day there before heading to Kyoto. In Kyoto, immerse yourself in the rich history and traditional Japanese culture. From Kyoto, drive towards Osaka, Japan's culinary capital and end your trip there. As for accommodations, you can consider the pet-friendly options such as the Japan Inn, Japan Grand Hotel, or Japan Stay & Go. Each city has a lot to offer and driving will give you the flexibility to explore at your own pace. Safe travels!

That sounds like a great adventure! Japan has a lot to offer for road trips. If you're planning on staying in pet-friendly hotels, here are some options for you:

3. Japan Stay & Go

Please note that the availability of these hotels may vary, so I would recommend booking in advance. Enjoy your trip!

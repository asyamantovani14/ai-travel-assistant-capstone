That sounds like a wonderful trip! Based on your preferences, I would recommend staying at one of our pet-friendly hotels in France such as the France Inn, France Grand Hotel or France Stay & Go. These options will allow you to comfortably travel with your dog. For your itinerary, you could start in the coastal city of Nice, known for its beautiful beaches and old town. Then, drive through the picturesque countryside to the town of Aix-en-Provence, which is famous for its historical and cultural sites. Continue your journey to the Luberon region, known for its charming small towns and incredible nature, before ending your trip in the historic city of Avignon. This itinerary combines nature, small towns and pet-friendly accommodations, perfect for you and your furry friend. Safe travels!

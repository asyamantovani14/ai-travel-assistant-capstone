Sure, for a road trip across southern France, you can start in Lyon, then head south to Avignon, then east to Nice, and finally southwest to Toulouse. 

In Lyon, you can walk along the Rhône River with your dog and enjoy the city's beautiful parks. For a pet-friendly accommodation, there is the France Inn.

Next, drive to Avignon, known for its stunning Papal Palace and the medieval stone bridge, Pont d'Avignon. You can stay at the France Grand Hotel, which is pet-friendly.

After Avignon, head to Nice, where you can explore the old town (Vieille Ville) and enjoy a walk on the Promenade des Anglais. Your pet-friendly hotel option here is France Stay & Go.

Lastly, make your way to Toulouse. Known as the Ville Rose (Pink City), it’s famous for its distinctive brick architecture. You can visit the Basilique Saint-Sernin, the largest remaining Romanesque building in Europe. You can choose to stay at either France Inn or France Grand Hotel, both are pet-friendly.

Remember to take breaks along the way to enjoy the beautiful French countryside, vineyards, and smaller towns. Enjoy your trip!

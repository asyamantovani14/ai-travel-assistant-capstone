Generated Response:
For your three-day trip to Barcelona with your dog, focused on food, I recommend staying at Barcelona Inn, Barcelona Grand Hotel, or Barcelona Stay & Go as they are all pet-friendly options. These hotels will provide a comfortable accommodation for both you and your furry friend while you explore the culinary delights of Barcelona. Be sure to check out local restaurants, cafes, and markets to indulge in delicious Spanish cuisine during your stay. Enjoy your trip!
